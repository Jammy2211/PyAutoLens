"""
The `ShapeSolver` validation suite.

`ShapeSolver` shipped in ~2024 with one method (`find_magnification`), its only test
commented out, and no consumer other than an unused workspace demo; the audit of
2026-08-19 called it effectively unmaintained. This module is the validation it never
had, written as part of the `image-source-mappings` epic, which reuses the solver as the
source -> image engine for non-pixelized sources.

Every case here is a statement about the *physics* the solver claims to compute, checked
against something that shares no code with it: the analytic magnification of an
Isothermal sphere, a grid-tracing oracle, the behaviour of shapes of equal area, and the
NumPy path itself. The bugs the suite found are named in the tests that pin them.
