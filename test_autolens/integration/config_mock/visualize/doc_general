A description of the general.ini visualization config.

[general]

    backend : str

        The matploblib backend used for visualization (see
        https://gist.github.com/CMCDragonkai/4e9464d9f32f5893d837f3de2c43daa4 for a description of backends).

        If you use an invalid backend for your computer, PyAutoLens may crash without an error or reset your machine.
        There may be no better way to find the right backend than simple trial and error. The following backends have
        worked for PyAutoLens users:

        TKAgg (default)
        Qt5Agg (works on new MACS)
        Qt4Agg
        WXAgg
        WX
        Agg (outputs to .fits / .png but doesn't'display figures during a run on your computer screen)

    visualize_interval : int

        The number of new best-fit (e.g. highest likelihood) models that must be sampled for PyAutoLens to output the 
        best-fit as a new set of figure / subplot visualization during a non-linear fit (e.g. on-the-fly).

        The figures are output according to the 'plots.ini' config file.

        A visualization_interval of -1 turns off on-the-fly visualization.

[units]

    int_kpc : bool

    If True, figures are output in units of kpc, using the lens & source redshifts to convert from arc seconds. If
    False, figures are output in arc-seconds.

[include]

    origin : bool

        If True, the origin of the coordinate system (e.g. 0.0", 0.0") is plotted on every figure. 
        
        The origin's appearance is specified by the [origin] section of the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.

    mask : bool

        If True, the mask used when fitting an image is plotted on every figure. 
        
        The mask's appearance is specified by the [mask] section of the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    grid : bool

        If True, image-plane grids (e.g. the centres of image pixels) and source-plane grids (e.g. traced pixels) are
        plotted on every figure 
       
        The grid's appearance is specified by the [grid] section of the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    border : bool

        If True, the border of a masked image (defined as the outer edges of its mask) is plotted on every figure 
        
        The border's appearance is specified by the [border] section of the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    critical_curves : bool

        If True, critical curves are plotted on all image-plane figures which have have mass profile(s) available, such 
        as the images of galaxies, planes, tracers and fits.

        The critical curve's appearances are specified by the [critical_curves] section of the 'figures.ini' and
        'subplots.ini' configs.

        If there are multiple critical curves (e.g radial, tangential) each will be colored differently according to
        the 'colors' specified in the configs above. By default, this color wheel matches the caustics so that
        critical curves that map to caustics are the same color.

    caustics : bool

        If True, casutics are plotted on all image-plane figures which have have mass profile(s) available, such as
        images of galaxies, planes, tracers and fits.
        
        Tthe caustics's appearance are specified by the [casutics] section of the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini'
        configs.

        If there are multiple caustics (e.g radial, tangential) each will be colored differently according to
        the 'colors' specified in the configs above. By default, this color wheel matches the critical curves so that
        critical curves that map to caustics are the same color.
        
    multiple_images : bool

        If True, the multiple images of the mass model are plotted on all image-plane figures which have a tracer
        available, namely images of tracers and fits.
        
        The multiple_images appearance is specified by the [multiple_images] section of the 'figures.ini' and
        'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    light_profile_centres : bool

        If True, the centre of all light profiles are plotted on figures which have have light profile(s) available, 
        such as the images of galaxies, planes, tracers and fits.
        
        The light_profile_centres appearance is specified by the [light_profile_centres] section of the 
        'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.

        If there are multiple galaxies with light profiles in a plane or tracer, light profile centres of the same
        galaxy are colored the same according to the 'colors' specified in the configs above. By default, this color
        wheel matches the mass profile centres so that light and mass profile centres of the same galaxies are colored
        the same.
        
    mass_profile_centres : bool

        If True, the centre of all mass profiles are plotted on figures which have have mass profile(s) available, 
        such as the images of galaxies, planes, tracers and fits.
        
        The mass_profile_centres appearance is specified by the [mass_profile_centres] section of the 
        'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.

        If there are multiple galaxies with mass profiles in a plane or tracer, mass profile centres of the same
        galaxy are colored the same according to the 'colors' specified in the configs above. By default, this color
        wheel matches the light profile centres so that light and mass profile centres of the same galaxies are colored
        the same.
        
    inversion_pixelization_grid : bool

        If True, the inversion's pixelization grid (e.g. the centre of every pixel of the pixelization) is plotted
        on figures of the inversion's reconstructed source.
       
        The inversion_pixelization_grid appearance is specified by the [inversion_pixelization_grid] section of 
        the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    inversion_grid : bool

        If True, the inversion's grid (e.g. the ray-traced grid of image pixels) is plotted on figures of the inversion's 
        reconstructed source.
       
        The inversion_grid appearance is specified by the [inversion_grid] section of 
        the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    inversion_border : bool

        If True, inversion's border (e.g. the ray-traced image pixels of all pixels on the edge of the mask in the 
        image-plane) is plotted on figures of the inversion's reconstructed source. Image-pixels which trace outside 
        this border may be relocated here before the inversion.
       
        The inversion_border appearance is specified by the [inversion_border] section of 
        the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
        
    inversion_image_pixelization_grid : bool

        If True, inversion's pixelizaion grid in the image-plane (e.g. the pixels which are traced to form the centre
        of every pixel of the pixelization) is plotted on fit_imaging figures of the image.
       
        The inversion_pixelization_grid appearance is specified by the [inversion_pixelization_grid] section of 
        the 'figures.ini' and 'subplots.ini' configs.
