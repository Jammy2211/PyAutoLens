# Python 3.12 is the default in Claude Code web/mobile sessions.
#
# The remote container ships /usr/local/bin/python{,3} -> /usr/bin/python3.11,
# a pip whose shebang is #!/usr/bin/python3, and a uv-managed tool set (pytest,
# ruff, black, mypy, pyright, flake8, poetry) every one of which was built on
# 3.11 — one minor version below the floor the organism set for itself in the
# Python 3.12 floor campaign, and below every CI leg it runs. The image's own
# `use-python 3.12` does not fix it: it moves the update-alternatives links
# under /usr/bin, which /usr/local/bin/python{,3} then shadow.
#
# This hook makes a session 3.12 on three surfaces:
#
#   1. a 3.12 virtualenv first on PATH — python, python3, pip, pytest;
#   2. the /usr/local/bin/python{,3} symlinks repointed at 3.12, so anything
#      resolving PATH without this session's env (a subprocess with a scrubbed
#      environment, a `#!/usr/bin/env python3` script) also gets 3.12;
#   3. the uv-managed tools rebuilt on 3.12 — mypy and flake8 read the
#      interpreter's version, so on 3.11 they judged code against 3.11 rules —
#      and then repaired, because (2) is what breaks each tool env's own
#      `bin/python`, and a rebuild cannot fix a link it is handed.
#
# What it deliberately does NOT touch: the update-alternatives links under
# /usr/bin. Scripts with a literal `#!/usr/bin/python3` shebang follow those,
# and some of the image's own tools (conan) are installed for 3.11 only — a
# flip there breaks them for no gain the three surfaces above don't already
# give.
#
# Remote-only (a local checkout keeps whatever the developer's shell provides),
# idempotent (everything is skipped once it already reads 3.12, so the second
# repo's copy in the same session costs ~0.2s), and non-blocking: every step
# degrades to a logged warning rather than failing the session start.
#
# Per-repo dependencies: a repo that needs more than pytest + PyYAML declares it
# in .claude/session-python.txt — one pip argument per line (`-e .`, a package
# spec, `-r requirements.txt`; `#` comments ignored). Installed additively into
# the shared venv, so the file stays out of this generated hook and the hook
# stays byte-identical in every repo.

# 2. What PATH means without this session's env file.
#
# This leg is the one that matters most, because the env file is exactly what a
# multi-repo session does NOT get: Claude Code registers project hooks from the
# session's project directory, that directory is the repos' parent, and no hook
# runs there (see leg 5). So every Bash call in such a session resolves whatever
# the image put on PATH, and these two names are the fallback that has to be
# right on its own.
#
# It used to point them at the BASE interpreter — `point_system_default
# "$(readlink -f "$VENV/bin/python")"` resolved the venv's python straight
# through to /usr/bin/python3.12. That satisfied the version question and lost
# everything else: `python3 -m pytest` answered "No module named pytest", and
# the session's own venv, sitting one directory away with pytest in it, was
# unreachable from any shell.
#
# Two details make the fix work:
#
#   * A wrapper script, not a symlink. Python resolves a symlinked executable
#     before looking for `pyvenv.cfg`, so a symlink to $VENV/bin/python lands on
#     the base interpreter's prefix and the venv is lost again — silently, and
#     in the same shape as the bug being fixed. `exec`ing it keeps the venv.
#   * --system-site-packages on the venv (see ensure_venv), so pointing the
#     system default here adds the session's packages without removing the
#     image's.
# Bounded, because this predicate is what runs a candidate interpreter — and
# the one failure mode worth surviving is an interpreter that never returns.

# 3b. The link uv's rebuild cannot fix from inside.

# uv creates each tool env with `bin/python` as a SYMLINK to whatever `python3`
# was at install time — here `/usr/local/bin/python3`, which leg 2 has already
# replaced with a wrapper that `exec`s the session venv. Every tool env's python
# then resolves its prefix to the VENV: `sys.prefix` is the venv, the tool's own
# site-packages never reaches `sys.path`, and the console script dies with
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flake8'` — with flake8 sitting
# installed two directories away.
#
# TWO paths reach that state, which is why this runs after leg 3 rather than
# only on the envs leg 3 rebuilt: leg 3 rebuilds a 3.11 tool and hands the new
# env the hijacked path, and leg 2 separately breaks every PRE-EXISTING tool env
# that already pointed there and that leg 3 skips (`is_py312 … && continue`).
# Running here covers both, because leg 2 runs before leg 3.
#
# Measured 2026-08-27, post-bootstrap: mypy, flake8, black, poetry and pyright
# all dead this way; `ruff` survived (a native binary) and `pytest` survived
# (leg 2b points its shim straight at the venv, which has pytest). The
# bootstrap's `--check` called every one of them "3.12 OK", because the
# interpreter they reach IS 3.12 — it is simply the wrong one. A session then
# lints clean by not linting at all, and CI is the thing that finds out.
#
# The fix is one link: a venv's `bin/python` must resolve to a BASE interpreter,
# never to a path this hook hijacks.
#
# This lived in `scripts/session_bootstrap.sh` for one pass, which is the wrong
# home. The bootstrap is what a MULTI-repo session runs; a SINGLE-repo session
# registers this hook and never calls the bootstrap, so it got leg 2's breakage

    # sessions behind it still had no workspace-root settings, and the next
    # session — three organs, project dir /home/user — fired no hook, ran on
    # PATH's pytest, and left both clones shallow for three minutes until an
    # unrelated verb happened to knock on session_bootstrap.sh.
