<3 numba but slower than Fortran


The above runs used a default SIE mass profile, below is what happens when I use the same SIE mass profile as the
Fortran code (which changes sub_to_image_grid).

It got slower. We're compairing a rectangular grid_2d to a adaptive ne though so lets come back to this...
