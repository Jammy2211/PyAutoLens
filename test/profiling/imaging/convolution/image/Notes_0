This is the first profiling of convolution on an _image_plane_images - it is slower than expected and being refactored, see
https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens/issues/30. .

The routine is slow because of the large number of -1 entries, which it iterates over. See
https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens/issues/30 .

I am now going to refactor frame convolver to remove these entries and reprofile the code
