Spherical is a lot faster than elliptical, because of the removal of rotations by an angle phi.

The jitted cases are faster that the non-jitted, but the speed up is minor.


The run-times of the AO case are not manageable regardless, considering we call this function for every profile.
Even the hst_up run-times are problematic for a large number of galaxies / profiles.

It is important to remember that we can significantly reduce the calls to this function for both light and
mass profiles by:

light-profiles and mass-profiles - Setup an adaptive sub-pixel grid, with the majority of pixels (away from the centre)
having just 1 central sub-pixel.

mass-profiles - Use the interpolation defleciton angle grid (provided the interpolation itself isn't super slow...)


A non-ideal speed-up nwould be to move the coordinate transforms into the jitted light profile intensity / mass profile
deflection calculations.


Can the jitted function I've written be sped up anymore? Im not sure how but one to revist maybe.
