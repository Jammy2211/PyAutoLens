        """
        Class which gets 1D attributes and adds them to a `Visuals1D` objects, such that they are plotted on 1D figures.

        For a visual to be extracted and added for plotting, it must have a `True` value in its corresponding entry in
        the `Include1D` object. If this entry is `False`, the `GetVisuals1D.get` method returns a None and the attribute
        is omitted from the plot.

        The `GetVisuals1D` class adds new visuals to a pre-existing `Visuals1D` object that is passed to its `__init__`
        method. This only adds a new entry if the visual are not already in this object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        include
            Sets which 1D visuals are included on the figure that is to be plotted (only entries which are `True`
            are extracted via the `GetVisuals1D` object).
        visuals
            The pre-existing visuals of the plotter which new visuals are added too via the `GetVisuals1D` class.
