"""
Analysis class for fitting a ``Tracer`` model to a point-source dataset.

``AnalysisPoint`` implements the ``log_likelihood_function`` called by a ``PyAutoFit``
non-linear search at each iteration.  It:

1. Constructs a ``Tracer`` from the current model instance.
2. Calls ``FitPointDataset`` to fit the point-source positions (and optionally fluxes
   and time delays) using the ``PointSolver`` to find predicted image positions.
3. Optionally adds a position-based prior via ``PositionsLH`` that penalises models
   where image positions are not self-consistent.
4. Returns the total log likelihood as the figure of merit.

It also manages result output (``ResultPoint``) and on-the-fly visualisation
(``VisualizerPoint``).

        Fits a lens model to a point source dataset (e.g. positions, fluxes, time delays) via a non-linear search.

        The `Analysis` class defines the `log_likelihood_function` which fits the model to the dataset and returns the
        log likelihood value defining how well the model fitted the data.

        It handles many other tasks, such as visualization, outputting results to hard-disk and storing results in
        a format that can be loaded after the model-fit is complete.

        This class is used for model-fits which fit lens models to point datasets, which may include some combination
        of positions, fluxes and time-delays.

        This class stores the settings used to perform the model-fit for certain components of the model (e.g. a
        pixelization or inversion), the Cosmology used for the analysis and adapt images used for certain model
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The `PointDataset` that is fitted by the model, which contains a combination of positions, fluxes and
            time-delays.
        solver
            Solves the lens equation in order to determine the image-plane positions of a point source by ray-tracing
            triangles to and from the source-plane.
        fit_positions_cls
            The class used to fit the positions of the point source dataset, which could be an image-plane or
            source-plane chi-squared.
        fit_flux_cls
            The class used to fit the fluxes of the point source dataset, which could be a free-flux
            (`FitFluxes`) or analytically-solved-flux (`FitFluxesSolved`) fit.
        fit_time_delays_cls
            The class used to fit the time delays of the point source dataset, which could be the
            min-subtraction (`FitTimeDelays`) or analytically-solved-reference-time (`FitTimeDelaysSolved`) fit.
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        title_prefix
            A string that is added before the title of all figures output by visualization, for example to
            put the name of the dataset and galaxy in the title.

        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the point source dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Tracer`, which includes ordering the galaxies
           by redshift to set up each `Plane`.

        2) Use the `Tracer` and other attributes to create a `FitPointDataset` object, which performs the steps
           below to fit different components of the point source dataset.

        3) If the point source dataset has positions and model fits positions, perform this fit and compute the
           log likelihood. This calculation uses the `fit_positions_cls` object, which may be an image-plane or
           source-plane chi-squared.

        4) If the point source dataset has fluxes and model fits fluxes, perform this fit and compute the log likelihood.

        5) If the point source dataset has time-delays and model fits time-delays, perform this fit and compute the
           log likelihood [NOT SUPPORTED YET].

        6) Sum the log likelihoods of the positions, fluxes and time-delays (if they are fitted) to get the overall
           log likelihood of the model.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example for ill defined mass models
        the `PointSolver` may find no solution. In such circumstances the model is discarded and its likelihood value
        is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
