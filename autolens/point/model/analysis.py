        """
        The analysis performed for model-fitting a point-source dataset, for example fitting the point-sources of a
        multiply imaged lensed quasar or supernovae of many source galaxies of a galaxy cluster.

        The analysis brings together the data, model and non-linear search in the classes `log_likelihood_function`,
        which is called by every iteration of the non-linear search to compute a likelihood value which samples
        parameter space.

        Parameters
        ----------
        point_dict
            A dictionary containing the full point source dictionary that is used for model-fitting.
        solver
            The object which is used to determine the image-plane of source-plane positions of a model (via a `Tracer`).
        dataset
            The imaging of the point-source dataset, which is not used for model-fitting but can be used for
            visualization.
        cosmology
            The cosmology of the ray-tracing calculation.
