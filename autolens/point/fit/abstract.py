        """
        Abstract class to fit a point source dataset using a `Tracer` object, including different components
        of the point source data like positions, fluxes and time delays.

        All sub-classes which fit specifc components of the point source data (e.g. positions, fluxes, time delays)
        inherit from this class, to provide them with general point-source functionality used in most
        calculations, for example the deflection angles and magnification of the point source.

        Point source fitting uses name pairing, whereby the `name` of the `Point` object is paired to the name of the
        point source dataset to ensure that point source datasets are fitted to the correct point source.

        This fit object is used in the `FitPointDataset` to perform fitting of a `PointDataset`, which may also fit
        the point dataset poisitions, fluxes and / or time delays.

        When performing a model-fit via an `AnalysisPoint` object the `figure_of_merit` of the child class
        is called and returned in the `log_likelihood_function`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of the point source dataset which is paired to a `Point` profile.
        data
            The positions of the point source in the image-plane which are fitted.
        noise_map
            The noise-map of the positions which are used to compute the log likelihood of the positions.
        tracer
            The tracer of galaxies whose point source profile are used to fit the positions.
        solver
            Solves the lens equation in order to determine the image-plane positions of a point source by ray-tracing
            triangles to and from the source-plane.
        profile
            Manually input the profile of the point source, which is used instead of the one extracted from the
            tracer via name pairing if that profile is not found.

        """
        Returns the deflection angle function, which for example given input image-plane positions computes their
        deflection angles.

        The use of this specific `deflections_func` property is not typical, using the `partial` function to wrap
        a deflections method of the tracer. This is essentially a trick so that, depending on whether multi-plane
        ray-tracing is to be performed, a different deflection function is used. This function is then
        used in `magnifications_at_positions` to compute the magnification of the point source account for
        multi-plane ray-tracing.

        For multi-plane ray-tracing with more than 2 planes, the deflection function determines the index of the
        plane with the last mass profile such that the deflection function does not perform unnecessary computations
        beyond this plane.

        TODO: Simplify this property and calculation of the deflection angles, as this property is confusing.
        TODO: This could be done by allowing for the Hessian to receive planes as input.

        1) For a source-plane chi-squared calculation, the residuals are multiplied by the magnification to account for
           how the noise in the image-plane positions is magnified to the source-plane, thus defining a
           better chi-squared.

        2) For fitting the fluxes of point sources, the magnification is used to scale the flux of the point source
           in the source-plane to the image-plane, thus computing the model image-plane fluxes.
