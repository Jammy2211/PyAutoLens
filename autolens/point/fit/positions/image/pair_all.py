class FitPositionsImagePairAll(AbstractFitPositionsImagePair):
    """
    Fits the positions of a a point source dataset using a `Tracer` object with an image-plane chi-squared where every
    model position of the point-source is paired with all other observed positions using the probability of each
    model posiition explaining each observed position.

    Pairing all model positions with all observed positions is a less intuitive and commonly used approach
    than other methods, for example pairing each position one-to-one. The scheme was proposed in the paper
    below and provides a number of benefits, for example being a fully Bayesian approach to the problem and
    linearizing aspects of the problem.

    https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15280

    THIS IMPLEMENTATION DOES NOT CURRRENTLY BREAK DOWN THE CALCULATION INTO A RESIDUAL MAP AND CHI-SQUARED,
    GOING STRAIGHT TO A `log_likelihood`. FUTURE WORK WILL WORK OUT HOW TO EXPRESS THIS IN TERMS OF A CHI-SQUARED
    AND RESIDUAL MAP.

    The fit performs the following steps:

    1) Determine the source-plane centre of the point source, which is either a free model parameter read from
       the profile's `centre` (`ag.ps.Point` / `ag.ps.PointFlux`) or, for `FitPositionsImagePairAllSolved`,
       solved for analytically given the current tracer (see `autolens.point.fit.solved.SolvedCentre`), using
       name pairing (see below).

    2) Determine the image-plane model positions using the `PointSolver` and the source-plane centre of the point
       source (e.g. ray tracing triangles to and from  the image and source planes), including accounting for
       multi-plane ray-tracing.

    3) Pair every model position with every observed position and return the overall log likelihood of the fit.

    Point source fitting uses name pairing, whereby the `name` of the `Point` object is paired to the name of the
    point source dataset to ensure that point source datasets are fitted to the correct point source.

    This fit object is used in the `FitPointDataset` to perform position based fitting of a `PointDataset`,
    which may also fit other components of the point dataset like fluxes or time delays.

    When performing a `model-fit`via an `AnalysisPoint` object the `figure_of_merit` of this object
    is called and returned in the `log_likelihood_function`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        The name of the point source dataset which is paired to a `Point` profile.
    data
        The positions of the point source in the image-plane which are fitted.
    noise_map
        The noise-map of the positions which are used to compute the log likelihood of the positions.
    tracer
        The tracer of galaxies whose point source profile are used to fit the positions.
    solver
        Solves the lens equation in order to determine the image-plane positions of a point source by ray-tracing
        triangles to and from the source-plane.
    profile
        Manually input the profile of the point source, which is used instead of the one extracted from the
        tracer via name pairing if that profile is not found.

        Compute the log likelihood for each permutation whereby the model could explain the observed image coordinates.

        For example, if there are two observed image coordinates and two model image coordinates, the log likelihood

        This is every way in which the coordinates generated by the model can explain the observed coordinates.

        The reduction over model positions is a max-shifted log-sum-exp rather than a literal

        ~38 sigma or worse, turning the log likelihood into `-inf` and killing gradient flow across the
        exact region gradient searches must traverse to find the basin. The shifted form is mathematically
        identical wherever the literal form is finite, and stays finite (the max term contributes exactly 0
        after the shift) at arbitrarily large mismatch.
