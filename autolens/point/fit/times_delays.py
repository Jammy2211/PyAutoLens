        """
        Fits the time delays of a point source dataset using a `Tracer` object,
        where every model time delay of the point-source is compared with its observed time delay.

        The fit performs the following steps:

        1) Compute the model time delays at the input image-plane `positions` using the tracer.

        2) Compute the relative time delays of the dataset time delays and the time delays of the point source at
           these positions, which are the time delays  relative to the shortest time delay

        2) Subtract the observed relative time delays from the model relative time delays to compute the residuals.

        3) Compute the chi-squared of each time delay residual.

        4) Sum the chi-squared values to compute the overall log likelihood of the fit.

        Time delay fitting uses name pairing similar to flux fitting to ensure
        the correct point source profile is used.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name
            The name of the point source dataset which is paired to a `Point` profile.
        data
            The observed time delays in days of the point source.
        noise_map
            The noise-map of the time delays in days used to compute the log likelihood.
        tracer
            The tracer of galaxies whose point source profile is used to fit the time delays.
        positions
            The image-plane positions of the point source where the time delays are calculated.
        profile
            Manually input the profile of the point source, used instead of one extracted from the tracer.
