"""
Image-plane point-source solver for strong gravitational lensing.

Finding the multiple images of a point source requires solving the lens equation
θ = β + α(θ) for θ given a fixed source-plane position β.  This is an inverse
problem with no analytic solution for general mass distributions.

``PointSolver`` solves this numerically using a triangle-tiling approach:

1. The image plane is tiled with triangles.
2. Each triangle is ray-traced to the source plane.
3. Triangles that contain the source-plane coordinate β are refined recursively.
4. The centroids of the final refined triangles give the image-plane positions.

The output positions array is padded to a fixed size (``MAX_CONTAINING_SIZE``) using the
sentinel value ``inf`` for JAX compatibility — these ``inf`` entries are stripped by
default but can be retained for use inside a ``jax.jit``-traced function.

        Solve for the image plane coordinates that are traced to the source plane coordinate.

        This is done by tiling the image plane with triangles and checking if the source plane coordinate is contained
        within the triangle. The triangles are sub-sampled to increase the resolution with only the triangles that
        contain the source plane coordinate and their neighbours being kept.

        The means of the triangles are then filtered to keep only those with an absolute magnification above the
        threshold.

        The positions are stored on an array of fixed shape defined by `MAX_CONTAINING_SIZE`. This ensures the
        array is static, which is important for JAX compatibility. This array typically has many entries
        which use the sentinel value of `inf`, subsequent JAX calculations incorporated. By default, these
        sentinel values are removed from the output, for example general use outside of JAX when simulating
        strong lenses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tracer
            The tracer that traces the image plane coordinates to the source plane.
        source_plane_coordinate
            The plane coordinate to trace to the image plane, which by default in the source-plane coordinate
            but could be a coordinate in another plane is `plane_redshift` is input.
        xp
            The array module (``numpy`` or ``jax.numpy``) the solve runs in. ``AnalysisPoint``
            passes ``jax.numpy`` when ``use_jax=True`` is set on the analysis. When ``None`` (the
            default), falls back to ``self._xp`` — which is ``jnp`` if the solver was constructed
            with ``use_jax=True`` and ``np`` otherwise. Pass explicitly to override.
        plane_redshift
            The redshift of the plane coordinate, which for multi-plane systems may not be the source-plane.
        remove_infinities
            Whether to strip the ``inf`` sentinel rows from the output. When ``None`` (the default),
            defaults to ``True`` on the NumPy path and ``False`` on the JAX path. The JAX path
            keeps the padded static shape so the output crosses a ``jax.jit`` boundary cleanly;
            strip the infinities outside the jit if needed.

        Returns
        -------
        A ``Grid2DIrregular`` of image-plane coordinates. NumPy-backed on the default path,
        ``jax.Array``-backed when ``use_jax=True`` (or ``xp=jnp``).

        Notes
        -----
        Smoke-test short-circuit (``PYAUTO_SMALL_DATASETS``): the triangle-tiling solve
        is the dominant cost in many simulator scripts and is meaningless on the
        downsized grids used for fast smoke tests. When ``PYAUTO_SMALL_DATASETS=1`` is
        set the solver returns the fixed pair ``[(1.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0)]`` immediately,
        skipping ``solve_triangles`` entirely. The two coordinates are well separated
        so any downstream ``positions_likelihood_from`` / threshold calculation behaves
        normally. ``PYAUTO_SMALL_DATASETS`` is a smoke-test-only flag and is never set
        inside a ``jax.jit`` trace, so a plain numpy-backed ``Grid2DIrregular`` is safe
        here even when the surrounding analysis uses ``xp=jnp``.
