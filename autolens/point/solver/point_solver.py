        """
        Solve for the image plane coordinates that are traced to the source plane coordinate.

        This is done by tiling the image plane with triangles and checking if the source plane coordinate is contained
        within the triangle. The triangles are sub-sampled to increase the resolution with only the triangles that
        contain the source plane coordinate and their neighbours being kept.

        The means of the triangles are then filtered to keep only those with an absolute magnification above the
        threshold.

        The positions are stored on an array of fixed shape defined by `MAX_CONTAINING_SIZE`. This ensures the
        array is static, which is important for JAX compatibility. This array typically has many entries
        which use the sentinel value of `inf`, subsequent JAX calculations incorporated. By default, these
        sentinel values are removed from the output, for example general use outside of JAX when simulating
        strong lenses.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source_plane_coordinate
            The plane coordinate to trace to the image plane, which by default in the source-plane coordinate
            but could be a coordinate in another plane is `plane_redshift` is input.
        tracer
            The tracer that traces the image plane coordinates to the source plane
        plane_redshift
            The redshift of the plane coordinate, which for multi-plane systems may not be the source-plane.

        Returns
        -------
        A list of image plane coordinates that are traced to the source plane coordinate.
