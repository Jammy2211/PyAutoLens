"""
Abstract triangle-tiling solver and shape-based solver for point-source positions.

``AbstractSolver`` (and its concrete subclass ``ShapeSolver``) implement the hierarchical
triangle-refinement algorithm that underlies ``PointSolver``:

1. An initial grid of triangles covers the image plane.
2. Each triangle is ray-traced to the source plane; those that contain the target
   source coordinate are kept.
3. Kept triangles are sub-divided for the next refinement iteration.
4. After ``n_steps`` levels the centroids of the finest triangles give the image positions.

``ShapeSolver`` extends this base with support for fitting extended source *shapes*
(e.g. rings, arcs) rather than point coordinates, used for morphological constraints.

        Determine the image plane coordinates that are traced to be a source plane coordinate.

        shrinks at every step, because the rim it adds is one triangle wide and the
        triangles halve. The residual on the converged kept area is roughly one triangle
        edge per boundary triangle -- see ``ShapeSolver.find_magnification``.

    silently ignored (``find_magnification`` hardcoded ``xp=np``); routing it through
    ``self._xp`` instead would have replaced a silently-ignored flag with a silently wrong
    number — an Isothermal sphere whose true magnification is 6.86 measures 0.13 under
    JAX. Lifting the cap is a redesign of the JAX containers, not a fix here, so the flag

        Find the magnification of the shape in the source plane.

        The magnification is the total image-plane area the shape's images cover divided by
        the shape's own area, measured on the kept triangles of the finest refinement step.

        Convergence and error
        ---------------------
        A triangle is kept when its *traced* image meets the shape, so the kept set covers
        the true image region plus a rim of boundary triangles which only partly overlap
        it. The area therefore approaches the true value **from above**, with an error of
        order ``perimeter * side_length`` — one triangle edge per boundary triangle. Since
        ``side_length`` at the finest step is ``pixel_scale_precision``, halving
        ``pixel_scale_precision`` roughly halves the error. For a source much larger than
        ``pixel_scale_precision`` this is a sub-percent effect; for a source comparable to
        it the answer is unreliable, and the caller should refine further.

        The other error is physical, not numerical: this measures the magnification of a
        *finite* shape, which equals the point magnification only in the limit of a small
        shape. An Isothermal sphere with ``einstein_radius=1.0`` and a source at
        ``beta=0.3`` has an analytic total magnification ``2 * theta_E / beta = 6.67``; at
        ``pixel_scale_precision=0.005`` a ``Circle`` of radius 0.2 gives 7.12 (7% high,
        finite-source), radius 0.1 gives 6.76 (1.3%) and radius 0.05 gives 6.66 (0.1%).

        Parameters
        ----------
        tracer
            A tracer that traces the image plane to the source plane.
        shape
            The shape of an image plane pixel.
        xp
            The array module the magnification calculation runs in. ``None`` (the default)
            falls back to ``self._xp``. This previously defaulted to ``np``
            unconditionally, so a solver built with ``use_jax=True`` silently ran in NumPy;
            it now consults the flag and raises, because the JAX path is wrong for a shape
            rather than merely unused (see the class docstring).
        plane_redshift
            The redshift of the source plane.
        per_image
            If ``True`` the kept triangles are grouped into their connected components (the
            separate multiple images) and one magnification is returned per image, largest
            first, dropping any component whose magnification does not exceed
            ``self.magnification_threshold``. If ``False`` (the default) the single total
            over every kept triangle is returned, unfiltered.

        Returns
        -------
        The magnification of the shape in the source plane, or the list of per-image
        magnifications when ``per_image=True``.

        Notes
        -----
        ``sum(per_image)`` is not identical to the total: the total is unfiltered, so it
        also carries any component the threshold rejects. For an Isothermal *sphere* the
        rejected component is the demagnified central image the profile's singular centre
        produces, worth ~0.004 of a magnification of 6.7.

        The image-plane regions (the multiple images) a source-plane shape maps to.

        This is the parametric-source counterpart of
        ``autoarray.inversion.mappings.image_regions_from``, which does the same job for a
        pixelized source via a ``Mapper``. Both return the same ``ImageRegion`` objects, so
        ``brightest_coordinate_from`` / ``centroid_from`` / ``flux_from`` / ``area`` behave
        identically whichever engine produced them.

        The kept triangles of the finest refinement step are grouped into connected
        components by shared vertices — each component is one multiple image — and each
        component is converted to an image-plane pixel region by marking every pixel of
        `grid` which contains a kept-triangle vertex or centroid. Because the triangles
        carry the geometry, a source far smaller than a pixel still produces regions.

        Components whose magnification (their share of the kept area, divided by the
        shape's area) does not exceed ``self.magnification_threshold`` are dropped. That
        threshold was previously accepted by the constructor and never used by
        ``ShapeSolver`` at all; without it the singular centre of an Isothermal sphere
        contributes a spurious two-triangle "image" at the lens centre.

def _image_region_from_triangles(
    triangles: np.ndarray, mask: aa.Mask2D
) -> Optional[aa.ImageRegion]:
    """
    The ``ImageRegion`` covered by a component of image-plane triangles.

    Every pixel of `mask` containing a triangle vertex or centroid is in the region. The
    region's boundary contours are the pixel-edge loops of that coverage (the same outline
    engine A draws for a pixelized source), so a ring is drawn as an annulus rather than as
    the filled disc a convex hull would give.

    Parameters
    ----------
    triangles
        An ``(n, 3, 2)`` array of ``(y, x)`` image-plane triangle vertices.
    mask
        The ``Mask2D`` of the image-plane grid, whose ``False`` entries are the data pixels.

    Returns
    -------
    The region, or ``None`` when no unmasked pixel of `mask` is covered.
