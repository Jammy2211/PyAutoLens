        ----------
        image
            The image before simulating (e.g. the lens and source galaxies before optics blurring and Imaging read-out).
        pixel_scales
            The scale of each pixel in arc seconds
        exposure_time_map
            An arrays representing the effective exposure time of each pixel.
        psf: PSF
            An arrays describing the PSF the simulated image is blurred with.
        add_poisson_noise_to_data: Bool
            If `True` poisson noise_maps is simulated and added to the image, based on the total counts in each image
            pixel
        noise_seed: int
            A seed for random noise_maps generation

           the simulated imaging data.
