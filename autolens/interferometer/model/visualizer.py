        Outputs images of the maximum log likelihood model inferred by the model-fit. This function is called
        throughout the non-linear search at input intervals, and therefore provides on-the-fly visualization of how
        well the model-fit is going.

        The visualization performed by this function includes:

        - Images of the best-fit `Tracer`, including the images of each of its galaxies.

        - Images of the best-fit `FitInterferometer`, including the model-image, residuals and chi-squared of its fit
          to the imaging data.

        - The adapt-images of the model-fit showing how the galaxies are used to represent different galaxies in
          the dataset.

        - If adapt features are used to scale the noise, a `FitInterferometer` with these features turned off may be
          output, to indicate how much these features are altering the dataset.

        The images output by this function are customized using the file `config/visualize/plots.yaml`.

        Performs visualization during the non-linear search of information that is

        dirty model image, source-plane reconstruction and dirty normalised residual
        map. The plot makes it easy to see how an emission line's source-plane

        analyses
            The list of all per-channel ``AnalysisInterferometer`` objects.

            The paths object which manages where visualisation is written to.
        instance
            A ``Collection`` of per-factor model instances. Iterating it yields one
            ``ModelInstance`` per channel, in the same order as ``analyses``.
        during_analysis
            ``True`` when called during the non-linear search, ``False`` when
            called after the search completes.
        quick_update
            ``True`` when called from the search's quick-update hook between
