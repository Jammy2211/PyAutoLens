        """
        Analysis classes are used by PyAutoFit to fit a model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        The `Analysis` class defines the `log_likelihood_function` which fits the model to the dataset and returns the
        log likelihood value defining how well the model fitted the data.

        It handles many other tasks, such as visualization, outputting results to hard-disk and storing results in
        a format that can be loaded after the model-fit is complete.

        This Analysis class is used for all model-fits which fit galaxies (or objects containing galaxies like a
        `Tracer`) to an interferometer dataset.

        This class stores the settings used to perform the model-fit for certain components of the model (e.g. a
        pixelization or inversion), the Cosmology used for the analysis and adapt images used for certain model
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The interferometer dataset that the model is fitted too.
        positions_likelihood
            An object which alters the likelihood function to include a term which accounts for whether
            image-pixel coordinates in arc-seconds corresponding to the multiple images of the lensed source galaxy
            trace close to one another in the source-plane.
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted, for example which linear algebra formalism is used.
        raise_inversion_positions_likelihood_exception
            If an inversion is used without the `positions_likelihood` it is likely a systematic solution will
            be inferred, in which case an Exception is raised before the model-fit begins to inform the user
            of this. This exception is not raised if this input is False, allowing the user to perform the model-fit
            anyway.

        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the interferometer dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) If the analysis has a adapt image, associated the model galaxy images of this dataset to the galaxies in
           the model instance.

        2) Extract attributes which model aspects of the data reductions, like the scaling the background sky
           and background noise.

        3) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Tracer`, which includes ordering the galaxies
           by redshift to set up each `Plane`.

        4) Use the `Tracer` and other attributes to create a `FitInterferometer` object, which performs steps such as
           creating model images of every galaxy in the plane, transforming them to the uv-plane via a Fourier transform
           and computing residuals, a chi-squared statistic and the log likelihood.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example if an `Inversion` is used, the
        linear algebra calculation may be invalid and raise an Exception. In such circumstances the model is discarded
        and its likelihood value is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a
        value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set

         Before the non-linear search begins, this routine saves attributes of the `Analysis` object to the `pickles`
         folder such that they can be loaded after the analysis using PyAutoFit's database and aggregator tools.

         For this analysis, it uses the `AnalysisDataset` object's method to output the following:

         - The dataset's data.
         - The dataset's noise-map.
         - The settings associated with the dataset.
         - The settings associated with the inversion.
         - The settings associated with the pixelization.
         - The Cosmology.
         - The adapt image's model image and galaxy images, if used.

         This function also outputs attributes specific to an imaging dataset:

        - Its uv-wavelengths
        - Its real space mask.
        - The positions of the brightest pixels in the lensed source which are used to discard mass models.
        - The preloaded image-plane source plane pixelization if used by the analysis. This ensures that differences in
        the scikit-learn library do not lead to different pixelizations being computed if results are transferred from
        a HPC to laptop.

         It is common for these attributes to be loaded by many of the template aggregator functions given in the
         `aggregator` modules. For example, when using the database tools to perform a fit, the default behaviour is for
         the dataset, settings and other attributes necessary to perform the fit to be loaded via the pickle files
         output by this function.
