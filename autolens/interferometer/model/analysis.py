"""
Analysis class for fitting a ``Tracer`` lens model to an interferometer dataset.

``AnalysisInterferometer`` implements the ``log_likelihood_function`` called by a
``PyAutoFit`` non-linear search at each iteration.  It:

1. Constructs a ``Tracer`` from the current model instance.
2. Optionally applies adaptive galaxy images to linear components.
3. Calls ``FitInterferometer`` to evaluate the log likelihood in the uv-plane.
4. Returns the figure of merit (log likelihood or log evidence).

It also manages result output (``ResultInterferometer``), on-the-fly visualisation
(``VisualizerInterferometer``), and position-based priors via ``PositionsLH``.

        Analysis classes are used by PyAutoFit to fit a model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        The `Analysis` class defines the `log_likelihood_function` which fits the model to the dataset and returns the
        log likelihood value defining how well the model fitted the data.

        It handles many other tasks, such as visualization, outputting results to hard-disk and storing results in
        a format that can be loaded after the model-fit is complete.

        This Analysis class is used for all model-fits which fit galaxies (or objects containing galaxies like a
        `Tracer`) to an interferometer dataset.

        This class stores the settings used to perform the model-fit for certain components of the model (e.g. a
        pixelization or inversion), the Cosmology used for the analysis and adapt images used for certain model
        classes.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The interferometer dataset that the model is fitted too.
        positions_likelihood_list
            Alters the likelihood function to include a term which accounts for whether image-pixel coordinates in
            arc-seconds corresponding to the multiple images of each lensed source galaxy trace close to one another in
            their source-plane. This is a list, as it may support multiple planes, where a positions likelihood object
            is input for each plane (e.g. double source plane lensing).
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        cosmology
            The Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted, for example which linear algebra formalism is used.
        raise_inversion_positions_likelihood_exception
            If an inversion is used without the `positions_likelihood_list` it is likely a systematic solution will
            be inferred, in which case an Exception is raised before the model-fit begins to inform the user
            of this. This exception is not raised if this input is False, allowing the user to perform the model-fit
            anyway.
        title_prefix
            A string that is added before the title of all figures output by visualization, for example to
            put the name of the dataset and galaxy in the title.
        shared_preloads
            Opts this analysis into the cross-factor shared-state mechanism of a `FactorGraphModel` (see
            `shared_state_from`). Set this to `True` only when this analysis is one of many datacube channels
            that share an identical lens model, so the channel-invariant inversion quantities (e.g. the
            `curvature_matrix`) can be computed once and reused by every channel. `False` by default, leaving
            the standard per-analysis behaviour unchanged.

        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the interferometer dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) If the analysis has a adapt image, associated the model galaxy images of this dataset to the galaxies in
           the model instance.

        2) Extract attributes which model aspects of the data reductions, like the scaling the background sky
           and background noise.

        3) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Tracer`, which includes ordering the galaxies
           by redshift to set up each `Plane`.

        4) Use the `Tracer` and other attributes to create a `FitInterferometer` object, which performs steps such as
           creating model images of every galaxy in the plane, transforming them to the uv-plane via a Fourier transform
           and computing residuals, a chi-squared statistic and the log likelihood.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example if an `Inversion` is used, the
        linear algebra calculation may be invalid and raise an Exception. In such circumstances the model is discarded
        and its likelihood value is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a
        value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set
            via a non-linear search).
        shared
            The cross-factor shared state of a `FactorGraphModel`, computed once per evaluation by the lead
            factor's `shared_state_from` (see that method). For this analysis it is a `PreloadsInterferometer`
            carrying the channel-invariant inversion quantities; when provided it is reused by the fit instead
            of being recomputed. `None` (the default, e.g. a standalone fit) leaves behaviour unchanged.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The log likelihood indicating how well this model instance fitted the interferometer data.

        Compute the channel-invariant inversion quantities once so they can be shared across the factors of a
        datacube `FactorGraphModel` (see `autofit.Analysis.shared_state_from`).

        When `shared_preloads` is set, every factor of the graph is an interferometer channel sharing the same
        lens model, so the inversion's `curvature_matrix` (`F = LᵀW̃L`) — the dominant inversion-setup cost — is
        identical for every channel. This builds it once on the lead factor and returns it inside a
        `PreloadsInterferometer`, which `FactorGraphModel` forwards as the `shared` argument to every factor's
        `log_likelihood_function`, so each channel reuses it instead of rebuilding it.

        Returns `None` when the analysis has not opted in (`shared_preloads=False`) or when the model performs no
        inversion, in which case no state is shared and every factor fits as normal.

        The caller is responsible for the invariance contract: only enable `shared_preloads` when the inversion
        quantities really are channel-invariant (e.g. the narrow-emission-line regime where `uv_wavelengths` and
        `noise_map` are ~channel-invariant). Outside it, leave `shared_preloads=False` so each channel computes

         Before the model-fit begins, this routine saves attributes of the `Analysis` object to the `files` folder

         For this analysis, it uses the `AnalysisDataset` object's method to output the following:

         - The settings associated with the inversion.
         - The settings associated with the pixelization.
         - The Cosmology.
         - The adapt image's model image and galaxy images, as `adapt_images.fits`, if used.

        - The positions of the brightest pixels in the lensed source which are used to discard mass models.

        The following .fits files are also output via the plotter interface:

        - The real space mask applied to the dataset, in the `PrimaryHDU` of `dataset.fits`.
        - The interferometer dataset as `dataset.fits` (data / noise-map / uv_wavelengths).
