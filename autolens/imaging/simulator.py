        Simulate an `Imaging` dataset from an input `Tracer` object and a 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates.

        The mass profiles of each galaxy in the tracer are used to perform ray-tracing of the input 2D grid and
        their light profiles are used to generate the image of the galaxies which are simulated.

        The steps of the `SimulatorImaging` simulation process (e.g. PSF convolution, noise addition) are
        described in the `SimulatorImaging` `__init__` method docstring, found in the PyAutoArray project.

        If one of more galaxy light profiles are a `LightProfileSNR` object, the `intensity` of the light profile is
        automatically set such that the signal-to-noise ratio of the light profile is equal to its input
        `signal_to_noise_ratio` value.

        For example, if a `LightProfileSNR` object has a `signal_to_noise_ratio` of 5.0, the intensity of the light
        profile is set such that the peak surface brightness of the profile is 5.0 times the background noise level of

        Simulate an `Imaging` dataset from an input deflection angle map and list of galaxies.

        The input deflection angle map ray-traces the image-plane coordinates from the image-plane to source-plane,

        This traced grid is then used to evaluate the light of the list of galaxies, which therefore simulate the
        image of the strong lens.

        This function is used in situations where one has access to a deflection angle map which does not suit being
        ray-traced using a `Tracer` object (e.g. deflection angles from a cosmological simulation of a galaxy).

        """
        Simulate an `Imaging` dataset from an input image of a source galaxy.

        This input image is on a uniform and regular 2D array, meaning it can simulate the source's irregular
        and asymmetric source galaxy morphological features.

        The typical use case is inputting the image of an irregular galaxy in the source-plane (whose values are
        on a uniform array) and using this function to compute the lensed image of this source galaxy.

        The tracer is used to perform ray-tracing and generate the image of the strong lens galaxies (e.g.
        the lens light, lensed source light, etc) which is simulated.

        The source galaxy light profiles are ignored in favour of the input source image, but the emission of
        other galaxies (e.g. the lems galaxy's light) are included.

        The steps of the `SimulatorImaging` simulation process (e.g. PSF convolution, noise addition) are
