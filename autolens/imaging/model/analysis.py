"""
Analysis class for fitting a ``Tracer`` lens model to an imaging dataset.

``AnalysisImaging`` implements the ``log_likelihood_function`` that a ``PyAutoFit``
non-linear search calls on each iteration.  It:

1. Constructs a ``Tracer`` from the current model instance.
2. Optionally applies adaptive galaxy images to linear components.
3. Calls ``FitImaging`` to evaluate the log likelihood.
4. Returns the figure of merit (log likelihood or log evidence).

It also manages result output (``ResultImaging``), on-the-fly visualisation
(``VisualizerImaging``), and position-based priors via ``PositionLikelihood``.

        """
        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the imaging dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) If the analysis has a adapt image, associated the model galaxy images of this dataset to the galaxies in
           the model instance.

        2) Extract attributes which model aspects of the data reductions, like the scaling the background sky
           and background noise.

        3) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Tracer`, which includes ordering the galaxies
           by redshift to set up each `Plane`.

        4) Use the `Tracer` and other attributes to create a `FitImaging` object, which performs steps such as creating
           model images of every galaxy in the tracer, blurring them with the imaging dataset's PSF and computing
           residuals, a chi-squared statistic and the log likelihood.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example if an `Inversion` is used, the
        linear algebra calculation may be invalid and raise an Exception. In such circumstances the model is discarded
        and its likelihood value is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a
        value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set
            via a non-linear search).
        shared
            The cross-factor shared state of a `FactorGraphModel`, computed once per evaluation by the lead
            factor's `shared_state_from` (see that method). For this analysis it is a `PreloadsImaging`
            carrying the exposure-invariant source-plane mesh geometry; when provided it is reused by the fit
            instead of being recomputed. `None` (the default, e.g. a standalone fit) leaves behaviour unchanged.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The log likelihood indicating how well this model instance fitted the imaging data.

    def shared_state_from(self, instance: af.ModelInstance):
        """
        Compute the exposure-invariant source-plane mesh geometry once so it can be shared across the factors
        of a multi-exposure `FactorGraphModel` (see `autofit.Analysis.shared_state_from`).

        When `shared_preloads` is set, every factor of the graph is an exposure of the same lens sharing an
        identical lens model, so the source-plane mesh (the image-mesh centres of this lead exposure,
        ray-traced through the shared lens model) is built once here and returned inside a `PreloadsImaging`,
        which `FactorGraphModel` forwards as the `shared` argument to every factor's
        `log_likelihood_function`. Each exposure then maps its own (offset) data grid onto the shared mesh
        instead of computing its own image-mesh and mesh ray-trace, so every exposure reconstructs on an
        identical source-pixel grid.

        Unlike the interferometer datacube case, the mapper, mapping matrix, curvature matrix and
        regularization matrix are NOT shared — per-exposure PSFs and pixel offsets make the first three
        per-dataset, and regularization may adapt to per-exposure data.

        Returns `None` when the analysis has not opted in (`shared_preloads=False`) or when the model performs
        no inversion, in which case no state is shared and every factor fits as normal.

        The caller is responsible for the invariance contract: only enable `shared_preloads` when the factors
        genuinely share the lens model, so the source-plane mesh really is exposure-invariant. The lead
        factor's own `DatasetModel` offset (if any) is applied when the mesh is traced, so the mesh is defined
        in the lead exposure's frame.
