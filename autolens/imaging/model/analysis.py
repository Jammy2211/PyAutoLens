        This function is called immediately before the non-linear search begins and performs final tasks and checks 
        before it begins.

        This function:

        - Checks that the adapt-dataset is consistent with previous adapt-datasets if the model-fit is being
          resumed from a previous run.

        - Checks the model and raises exceptions if certain critieria are not met.

        Once inherited from it also visualizes objects which do not change throughout the model fit like the dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        paths
            The PyAutoFit paths object which manages all paths, e.g. where the non-linear search outputs are stored,
            visualization and the pickled objects used by the aggregator output by this function.
        model
            The PyAutoFit model object, which includes model components representing the galaxies that are fitted to
            the imaging data.

        """
        Given an instance of the model, where the model parameters are set via a non-linear search, fit the model
        instance to the imaging dataset.

        This function returns a log likelihood which is used by the non-linear search to guide the model-fit.

        For this analysis class, this function performs the following steps:

        1) If the analysis has a adapt image, associated the model galaxy images of this dataset to the galaxies in
           the model instance.

        2) Extract attributes which model aspects of the data reductions, like the scaling the background sky
           and background noise.

        3) Extracts all galaxies from the model instance and set up a `Tracer`, which includes ordering the galaxies
           by redshift to set up each `Plane`.

        4) Use the `Tracer` and other attributes to create a `FitImaging` object, which performs steps such as creating
           model images of every galaxy in the tracer, blurring them with the imaging dataset's PSF and computing
           residuals, a chi-squared statistic and the log likelihood.

        Certain models will fail to fit the dataset and raise an exception. For example if an `Inversion` is used, the
        linear algebra calculation may be invalid and raise an Exception. In such circumstances the model is discarded
        and its likelihood value is passed to the non-linear search in a way that it ignores it (for example, using a
        value of -1.0e99).

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set

        Returns
        -------

        Before the non-linear search begins, this routine saves attributes of the `Analysis` object to the `pickles`
        folder such that they can be loaded after the analysis using PyAutoFit's database and aggregator tools.

        For this analysis, it uses the `AnalysisDataset` object's method to output the following:

        - The dataset's data.
        - The dataset's noise-map.
        - The settings associated with the dataset.
        - The settings associated with the inversion.
        - The settings associated with the pixelization.
        - The Cosmology.
        - The adapt image's model image and galaxy images, if used.

        This function also outputs attributes specific to an imaging dataset:

        - Its PSF.
        - Its mask.
        - The positions of the brightest pixels in the lensed source which are used to discard mass models.
        - The preloaded image-plane source plane pixelization if used by the analysis. This ensures that differences in
          the scikit-learn library do not lead to different pixelizations being computed if results are transferred from
          a HPC to laptop.

        It is common for these attributes to be loaded by many of the template aggregator functions given in the
        `aggregator` modules. For example, when using the database tools to perform a fit, the default behaviour is for
        the dataset, settings and other attributes necessary to perform the fit to be loaded via the pickle files
        output by this function.
