        Fits an imaging dataset using a `Tracer` object.

        The fit performs the following steps:

        1) Compute the sum of all images of galaxy light profiles in the `Tracer`.

        2) Blur this with the imaging PSF to created the `blurred_image`.

        3) Subtract this image from the `data` to create the `profile_subtracted_image`.

        4) If the `Tracer` has any linear algebra objects (e.g. linear light profiles, a pixelization / regulariation)
           fit the `profile_subtracted_image` with these objects via an inversion.

        5) Compute the `model_data` as the sum of the `blurred_image` and `reconstructed_data` of the inversion (if
           an inversion is not performed the `model_data` is only the `blurred_image`.

        6) Subtract the `model_data` from the data and compute the residuals, chi-squared and likelihood via the
           noise-map (if an inversion is performed the `log_evidence`, including additional terms describing the linear
           algebra solution, is computed).

        When performing a `model-fit`via an `AnalysisImaging` object the `figure_of_merit` of this `FitImaging` object
        is called and returned in the `log_likelihood_function`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The imaging dataset which is fitted by the galaxies in the tracer.
        tracer
            The tracer of galaxies whose light profile images are used to fit the imaging data.
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted for example which linear algebra formalism is used.
        preloads
            Contains preloaded calculations (e.g. linear algebra matrices) which can skip certain calculations in
            the fit.
        run_time_dict
            A dictionary which if passed to the fit records how long function calls which have the `profile_func`
            decorator take to run.
