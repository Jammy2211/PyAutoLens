"""Lazy JAX pytree registration for `Tracer` and the classes it contains.

When a user wraps a PyAutoLens call in their own ``@jax.jit`` and the call
receives a ``Tracer`` as a traced argument, every concrete class reachable
from the tracer must be registered as a JAX pytree node so JAX can flatten
and unflatten across the JIT boundary.

This module is the counterpart of ``AnalysisImaging._register_fit_imaging_pytrees``
for code paths that do not go through ``Analysis`` (point-source solving,
custom forward models, hand-built simulators).

**Calling it is the user's responsibility.** Nothing in the library calls it
for you, and nothing can: JAX flattens a jitted function's arguments at trace
time, i.e. *before* entering the callee, so a ``solve()`` or
``via_tracer_from()`` that registered internally would already be too late.
``PointSolver.solve_triangles`` carries the same note at its own call site.
Register once, before the first ``@jax.jit`` invocation.

The autogalaxy counterpart is ``autogalaxy.jax.register_galaxies_classes``.

Mirrors PyAutoFit's ``autofit/jax/pytrees.py`` layout. Idempotent: re-registration
of a class is a silent no-op.
