        The `PositionsLH` objects add a penalty term to the likelihood of the **PyAutoLens** `log_likelihood_function`

        The penalty term inspects the distance that the locations of the multiple images of the lensed source galaxy
        trace within one another in the source-plane and penalizes solutions where they trace far from one another,
        on the basis that this indicates an unphysical or inaccurate mass model. If they trace within the
        threshold the penalty term is not applied.

        For example, for one penalty term, if the multiple image coordinates are defined
        via `positions=aa.Grid2DIrregular([(1.0, 0.0), (-1.0, 0.0)]` and they do not trace within `threshold=0.3` of
        one another, the mass model will be rejected and a new model sampled.
