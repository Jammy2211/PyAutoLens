        If the standard point solver only locates one multiple image, finds one or more additional images, which are
        not technically multiple image in the point source regime, but are close enough to it they can be used
        in a position threshold likelihood.

        This is performed by incrementally moving the source-plane centre's coordinates towards the centre of the
        source-plane at (0.0", 0.0"). This ensures that the centre will eventually go inside the caustic, where
        multiple images are formed.

        To move the source-plane centre, the original source-plane centre is multiplied by a factor that decreases
        from 1.0 to 0.0 in increments of 1/increments. For example, if the source-plane centre is (1.0", -0.5") and
        the `factor` is 0.5, the input source-plane centre is (0.5", -0.25").

        The multiple images are always computed for the same mass model, thus they will always be valid multiple images
        for the model being fitted, but as the factor decrease the multiple images may move furhter from their observed
        positions.

        Compute a new position threshold from these results corresponding to the image-plane multiple image positions
        of the maximum log likelihood `Tracer` ray-traced to the source-plane.

        First, we ray-trace forward the multiple-image's to the source-plane via the mass model to determine how far
        apart they are separated. We take the maximum source-plane separation of these points and multiple this by
        the auto_positions_factor to determine a new positions threshold. This value may also be rounded up to the
        input `auto_positions_minimum_threshold`.

        This is used for non-linear search chaining, specifically updating the position threshold of a new model-fit
        using the maximum likelihood model of a previous search.

        The above behaviour assumes a single lens and single source plane, if there are multiple source planes (e.g.
        a double source plane lens) the input `plane_redshift_list` can be used to specify which source planea
        the position threshold is computed for.

        Parameters
        ----------
        factor
            The value the computed threshold is multiplied by to make the position threshold larger or smaller than the
            maximum log likelihood model's threshold.
        minimum_threshold
            The output threshold is rounded up to this value if it is below it, to avoid extremely small threshold
            values.
        positions
            If input, these positions are used instead of the computed multiple image positions from the lens mass

        Returns a `PositionsLH` object from the result of a lens model-fit, where the maximum log likelihood mass
        and source models are used to determine the multiple image positions in the image-plane and source-plane
        and ray-trace them to the source-plane to determine the threshold.

        In chained fits, for example the SLaM pipelines, this means that a simple initial fit (e.g. SIE mass model,
        parametric source) can be used to determine the multiple image positions and threshold for a more complex
        subsequent fit (e.g. power-law mass model, pixelized source).

        The mass model central image is removed from the solution, as this is rarely physically observed and therefore
        should not be included in the likelihood penalty or resampling. It is removed by setting a positive
        magnification threshold in the `PointSolver`. For strange lens models the central image may still be
        solved for, in which case the `mass_centre_radial_distance_min` parameter can be used to remove it.

        mass_centre_radial_distance_min
            The minimum radial distance from the mass model centre that a multiple image position must be to be
            included in the likelihood penalty or resampling. If `None` all positions are used. This is an additional
            method to remove central images that may make it through the point solver's magnification threshold.
