"""
Result classes for **PyAutoLens** model fits.

This module defines the ``Result`` and ``ResultDataset`` classes that wrap the output of
a ``PyAutoFit`` non-linear search for lensing model fits.  Key properties include:

- ``max_log_likelihood_tracer`` — reconstructs the best-fit ``Tracer`` from the stored
  model instance.
- ``source_plane_light_profile_centre_from`` — extracts the source-plane light-profile
  centre, used by automatic position updating to seed position priors for the next
  search in a SLaM pipeline.
- ``image_plane_multiple_image_positions_from`` — uses a ``PointSolver`` to compute the
  image-plane multiple-image positions predicted by the best-fit tracer, optionally
  filtered by a minimum flux threshold.

These results feed directly into downstream pipeline stages and post-processing scripts.

        Compute a new position threshold from these results corresponding to the image-plane multiple image positions

        First, we ray-trace forward the multiple-image's to the source-plane via the mass model to determine how far

        using the maximum likelihood model of a previous search.

        a double source plane lens) the input `plane_redshift_list` can be used to specify which source planea

        Returns a `PositionsLH` object from the result of a lens model-fit, where the maximum log likelihood mass
        and source models are used to determine the multiple image positions in the image-plane and source-plane
        and ray-trace them to the source-plane to determine the threshold.

        In chained fits, for example the SLaM pipelines, this means that a simple initial fit (e.g. SIE mass model,
        parametric source) can be used to determine the multiple image positions and threshold for a more complex
        subsequent fit (e.g. power-law mass model, pixelized source).

        The mass model central image is removed from the solution, as this is rarely physically observed and therefore
        should not be included in the likelihood penalty or resampling. It is removed by setting a positive
        magnification threshold in the `PointSolver`. For strange lens models the central image may still be
        solved for, in which case the `mass_centre_radial_distance_min` parameter can be used to remove it.

        positions
            If input, these positions are used instead of the computed multiple image positions from the lens mass
            model.
        mass_centre_radial_distance_min
            The minimum radial distance from the mass model centre that a multiple image position must be to be
            included in the likelihood penalty or resampling. If `None` all positions are used. This is an additional
            method to remove central images that may make it through the point solver's magnification threshold.
        plane_redshift
            The plane redshift of the lensed source, which is only required when a double (or triple) source plane lens
            system is being analysed where the specific plane via its redshift is required to define whihch source
            galaxy is used to compute the multiple images.

        Notes
        -----
        Test-mode safeguard (``PYAUTO_TEST_MODE``): integration tests intentionally fit
        random / unphysical mass models and the resulting tracer often back-traces to
        zero, NaN, or inf image-plane positions. Computing a position threshold from
        such positions raises ``ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation
        fmax`` (or propagates NaN) inside ``positions_threshold_from``. When test mode
        is active and the resolved positions are empty, contain NaN, or contain inf,
        we substitute the synthetic pair ``[(1.0, 0.0), (-1.0, 0.0)]`` so the threshold
        and ``PositionsLH`` still build cleanly and the script runs end-to-end.
        Outside test mode this branch is never taken — bad positions still surface as
        the original error, so production fits are not silently masked.

        Skip-checks safeguard (``PYAUTO_SKIP_CHECKS``): when validation checks are
        skipped *and* test mode is active, we return a ``PositionsLH`` built from the
        same synthetic ``[(1.0, 0.0), (-1.0, 0.0)]`` pair (with threshold set to
        ``minimum_threshold`` or 0.5 if unset). This avoids the expensive
        multiple-image-position computation while still giving callers a usable
        ``PositionsLH``, so workspace scripts that chain ``.positions`` continue to
        work end-to-end. With skip-checks alone (no test mode) the function still
        returns ``None`` — the production opt-out behaviour is unchanged.
