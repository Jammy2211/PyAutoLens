        Fits a lens model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        This abstract Analysis class has attributes and methods for all model-fits which fit the model to a dataset
        (e.g. imaging or interferometer data).

        This class stores the Cosmology used for the analysis and settings that control aspects of the calculation,
        including how pixelizations, inversions and lensing calculations are performed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The imaging, interferometer or other dataset that the model if fitted too.
        positions_likelihood_list
            Alters the likelihood function to include a term which accounts for whether image-pixel coordinates in
            arc-seconds corresponding to the multiple images of each lensed source galaxy trace close to one another in
            their source-plane. This is a list, as it may support multiple planes, where a positions likelihood object
            is input for each plane (e.g. double source plane lensing).
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        cosmology
            The AstroPy Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted during the model-fit, for example which linear algebra
            formalism is used.
        raise_inversion_positions_likelihood_exception
            If an inversion is used without the `positions_likelihood_list` it is likely a systematic solution will
            be inferred, in which case an Exception is raised before the model-fit begins to inform the user
            of this. This exception is not raised if this input is False, allowing the user to perform the model-fit
            anyway.
