        Analysis classes are used by PyAutoFit to fit a model to a dataset via a non-linear search.

        This abstract Analysis class has attributes and methods for all model-fits which include lensing calculations,

        This class stores the Cosmology used for the analysis and settings that control specific aspects of the lensing
        calculation, for example how close the brightest pixels in the lensed source have to trace within one another
        in the source plane for the model to not be discarded.

        This function handles a number of exceptions which may occur when calling the overwrite function via the

        Parameters
        ----------
        instance
            An instance of the model that is being fitted to the data by this analysis (whose parameters have been set
            via a non-linear search).

        The penalty value of the positions log likelihood, if the positions do not trace close in the source plane,

        This abstract Analysis class has attributes and methods for all model-fits which fit the model to a dataset
        (e.g. imaging or interferometer data).

        This class stores the Cosmology used for the analysis and settings that control aspects of the calculation,
        including how pixelizations, inversions and lensing calculations are performed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The imaging, interferometer or other dataset that the model if fitted too.
        positions_likelihood
            An object which alters the likelihood function to include a term which accounts for whether
            image-pixel coordinates in arc-seconds corresponding to the multiple images of the lensed source galaxy
            trace close to one another in the source-plane.
        adapt_images
            Contains the adapt-images which are used to make a pixelization's mesh and regularization adapt to the
            reconstructed galaxy's morphology.
        cosmology
            The AstroPy Cosmology assumed for this analysis.
        settings_inversion
            Settings controlling how an inversion is fitted during the model-fit, for example which linear algebra
            formalism is used.
        raise_inversion_positions_likelihood_exception
            If an inversion is used without the `positions_likelihood` it is likely a systematic solution will
            be inferred, in which case an Exception is raised before the model-fit begins to inform the user
            of this. This exception is not raised if this input is False, allowing the user to perform the model-fit
            anyway.
