    """
    Returns a list of `FitImaging` object from a `PyAutoFit` sqlite database `Fit` object.

    The results of a model-fit can be stored in a sqlite database, including the following attributes of the fit:

    - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
    - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset/mask.fits`).
    - The settings of inversions used by the fit (`dataset/settings_inversion.json`).

    Each individual attribute can be loaded from the database via the `fit.value()` method.

    This method combines all of these attributes and returns a `FitImaging` object for a given non-linear search sample
    (e.g. the maximum likelihood model). This includes associating adapt images with their respective galaxies.

    If multiple `FitImaging` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
    is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
    `FitImaging` objects.

    The settings of a pixelization of inversion can be overwritten by inputting a `settings_dataset` object, for example
    if you want to use a grid with a different inversion solver.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit
        A `PyAutoFit` `Fit` object which contains the results of a model-fit as an entry in a sqlite database.
    instance
        A manual instance that overwrites the max log likelihood instance in fit (e.g. for drawing the instance
        randomly from the PDF).
    settings_dataset
        Optionally overwrite the `SettingsImaging` of the `Imaging` object that is created from the fit.
    settings_inversion
        Optionally overwrite the `SettingsInversion` of the `Inversion` object that is created from the fit.
    use_preloaded_grid
        Certain pixelization's construct their mesh in the source-plane from a stochastic KMeans algorithm. This grid
        may be output to hard-disk after the model-fit and loaded via the database to ensure the same grid is used
        as the fit.

        """
        Interfaces with an `PyAutoFit` aggregator object to create instances of `FitImaging` objects from the results
        of a model-fit.

        The results of a model-fit can be stored in a sqlite database, including the following attributes of the fit:

        - The imaging data, noise-map, PSF and settings as .fits files (e.g. `dataset/data.fits`).
        - The mask used to mask the `Imaging` data structure in the fit (`dataset/mask.fits`).
        - The settings of inversions used by the fit (`dataset/settings_inversion.json`).

        The `aggregator` contains the path to each of these files, and they can be loaded individually. This class
        can load them all at once and create an `FitImaging` object via the `_fit_imaging_from` method.

        This class's methods returns generators which create the instances of the `FitImaging` objects. This ensures
        that large sets of results can be efficiently loaded from the hard-disk and do not require storing all
        `FitImaging` instances in the memory at once.

        For example, if the `aggregator` contains 3 model-fits, this class can be used to create a generator which
        creates instances of the corresponding 3 `FitImaging` objects.

        If multiple `FitImaging` objects were fitted simultaneously via analysis summing, the `fit.child_values()` method
        is instead used to load lists of the data, noise-map, PSF and mask and combine them into a list of
        `FitImaging` objects.

        This can be done manually, but this object provides a more concise API.

        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregator
            A `PyAutoFit` aggregator object which can load the results of model-fits.
        settings_dataset
            Optionally overwrite the `SettingsImaging` of the `Imaging` object that is created from the fit.
        settings_inversion
            Optionally overwrite the `SettingsInversion` of the `Inversion` object that is created from the fit.
        use_preloaded_grid
            Certain pixelization's construct their mesh in the source-plane from a stochastic KMeans algorithm. This
            grid may be output to hard-disk after the model-fit and loaded via the database to ensure the same grid is
            used as the fit.
