        Interfaces a dataset and tracer with the inversion module, to setup a linear algebra calculation.

        The tracer's galaxies may contain linear light profiles whose `intensity` values are solved for via linear
        algebra in order to best-fit the data. In this case, this class extracts the linear light profiles of all
        galaxies, performs ray-tracing and computes their images and passes them to the `inversion` module such that
        they become  the `mapping_matrix` used in the linear algebra calculation.

        The galaxies may also contain pixelizations, which use a mesh (e.g. a Voronoi mesh) and regularization scheme
        to reconstruct the galaxy's light. This class extracts all pixelizations, performs ray-tracing and uses the
        pixelizations to set up `Mapper` objects which pair the dataset and pixelization to again set up the
        appropriate `mapping_matrix` and other linear algebra matrices (e.g. the `regularization_matrix`).

        This class does not perform the inversion or compute any of the linear algebra matrices itself. Instead,
        it acts as an interface between the dataset and galaxies and the inversion module, extracting the
        necessary information from galaxies and passing it to the inversion module.

        The tracer's galaxies may also contain standard light profiles which have an input `intensity` which is not
        solved for via linear algebra. These profiles should have already been evaluated and subtracted from the
        dataset before the inversion is performed. This is how an inversion is set up in the fit
        modules (e.g. `FitImaging`).

        Parameters
        ----------
        dataset
            The dataset containing the data which the inversion is performed on.
        tracer
            The tracer whose galaxies are fitted to the dataset via the inversion.
        adapt_images
            Images which certain pixelizations use to adapt their properties to the dataset, for example congregating
            the pixelization's pixels to the brightest regions of the image.
        settings_inversion
            The settings of the inversion, which controls how the linear algebra calculation is performed.
        preloads
            Preloads of the inversion, which are used to speed up the linear algebra calculation.
        run_time_dict
            A dictionary of run-time values used to compute the inversion, for example the noise-map normalization.

        Returns a dictionary associating each list of linear light profiles with the galaxy they belong to.

        You should first refer to the docstring of the `cls_light_profile_func_list_galaxy_dict_from` method in the
        parent project PyAutoGalaxy for a description of this method.

        In brief, this method iterates over all galaxies and their light profiles, extracting their linear light
        profiles and for each galaxy grouping them into a `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object, which is associated
        with the galaxy via the dictionary. It also extracts linear light profiles from `Basis` objects and makes this
        associated.

        When extracting the linear light profiles, ray-tracing is also performed to ensure that each grid input
        into the linear light profile corresponds to the grid for the plane the galaxy is in, derived from the
        galaxy's redshift.

        This function also handles some aspects of over-sampling, because the implementation of adaptive
        over-sampling in a tracer is quite confusing. My hope is that this will be removed in the future,
        so just try ignore it for now.

        The `LightProfileLinearObjFuncList` object contains the attributes (e.g. the data `grid` after ray tracing,
        `light_profiles`) and functionality (e.g. a `mapping_matrix` method) that are required to perform the inversion.

        This function first creates a dictionary of linear light profiles associated with each galaxy for each plane,
        and then does the same for all `Basis` objects. The two dictionaries are then combined and returned.

        Returns
        -------
        A dictionary associating each list of linear light profiles and basis objects with the galaxy they belong to.

        Returns an inversion object from the dataset, galaxies and inversion settings.

        The inversion uses all linear light profiles and pixelizations of the galaxies in the tracer to fit the data,
        fully accounting for ray tracing.

        It solves for the linear light profile intensities and pixelization mesh pixel values via linear algebra,
        finding the solution which best fits the data after regularization is applied.

        The `TracerToInversion` object acts as an interface between the dataset and tracer and the inversion module,
        with many of its functions required to set up the inputs to the inversion object, primarily
        the `linear_obj_list` and `linear_obj_galaxy_dict` properties.
