        Performs gravitational lensing ray-tracing calculations based on an input list of galaxies and a cosmology.

        The tracer stores the input galaxies in their input order, which may not be in ascending redshift order.
        However, for all ray-tracing calculations, the tracer orders the input galaxies in ascending order of redshift,
        as this is required for the multi-plane ray-tracing calculations.

        The tracer then creates a series of planes, where each plane is a collection of galaxies at the same redshift.

        The redshifts of these planes are determined by the redshifts of the galaxies, such that there is a unique
        plane redshift for every unique galaxy redshift (galaxies with identical redshifts are put in the same plane).

        Gravitational lensing calculations are then performed individually for each plane and combined to produce the
        correct overall lensing calculation. This includes the calculations like the deflection angles, create
        images of the galaxies at different planes, and the overall lensed image of all galaxies.

        Multi-plane ray-tracing work natively, whereby the redshifts of the planes are used to perform multi-plane
        ray-tracing calculations. This uses the input cosmology so that deflection-angles are rescaled according to
        the lens-geometry of the multi-plane system.

        The `Tracer` object is also the core of the lens modeling API, whereby a model tracer is created via
        the `PyAutoFit` `af.Model` object.

        Returns a tracer where the lens system is split into planes with specified redshift distances between them.

        This is used for ray-tracing systems with many galaxies at different redshifts (e.g. hundreds or more). If
        each galaxy redshift is treated indepedently, this would require many planes to be created, and the multi-plane
        ray-tracing calculation would be computationally slow.

        To speed the calculation up, the galaxies are grouped into planes with redshifts separated by the inputs.
        To achieve this, the galaxies have their redshifts reassigned from their original values to the nearest
        value of a sliced plane redshift. This ensures that every galaxy is in a subset of planes.

        The redshifts of the planes are determines as follows:

        - Use the redshifts of the lens galaxies to determine the redshifts of the planes, where a lens galaxy is
        expected to have a large mass and thus contribute to a significant portion of the overall lensing. This ensures
        the main lens galaxies have a redshift and plane to themselves, ensuring calculation accuracy.

        - Use the redshift of the source galaxies to determine the redshift of the source plane, ensuring the source
        galaxies also have a dedicated redshift and plane for calculation accuracy.

        - Create N planes between Earth and the first lens galaxy, the lens galaxy and the next lens galaxy (and so on)
        up to the source galaxy. The number of planes between each set of galaxies is specified by the input
        `planes_between_lenses`, where for a lens / source system `planes_between_lenses=[2,3]` would mean there are 2
        planes between Earth and the lens galaxy and 3 planes between the lens and source galaxy.

        - The `line_of_sight_galaxies` are placed in the planes corresponding to their closest redshift.

        Parameters

        lens_galaxies
            The lens galaxies in the ray-tracing calculation. Most use cases will have only one lens galaxy, but the

        line_of_sight_galaxies
            The galaxies in the line-of-sight to the primary lens galaxy, which may have many different redshifts
            and therefore create computational expensive multi-plane ray-tracing calculations without the plane
            grouping provided by this method.
        source_galaxies
            The source galaxies in the ray-tracing calculation. The API only supports one source galaxy (input multiple
            lens galaxies to build a multi-plane system).
        planes_between_lenses
            The number of slices between each main plane. The first entry in this list determines the number of slices
            between Earth (redshift 0.0) and the first lens galaxy, the next between the lens and source, etc.

        """
        Returns a ray-traced grid of 2D Cartesian (y,x) coordinates which accounts for multi-plane ray-tracing.

        This uses the redshifts and mass profiles of the galaxies contained within the tracer to perform the multi-plane
        ray-tracing calculation.

        This function returns a list of 2D (y,x) grids, corresponding to each redshift in the input list of planes. The
        plane redshifts are determined from the redshifts of the galaxies in each plane, whereby there is a unique plane
        at each redshift containing all galaxies at the same redshift.

        For example, if the `planes` list contains three lists of galaxies with `redshift`'s z0.5, z=1.0 and z=2.0, the
        returned list of traced grids will contain three entries corresponding to the input grid after ray-tracing to
        redshifts 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.

        An input `AstroPy` cosmology object can change the cosmological model, which is used to compute the scaling
        factors between planes (which are derived from their redshifts and angular diameter distances). It is these
        scaling factors that account for multi-plane ray tracing effects.

        The calculation can be terminated early by inputting a `plane_index_limit`. All planes whose integer indexes are
        above this value are omitted from the calculation and not included in the returned list of grids (the size of
        this list is reduced accordingly).

        For example, if `planes` has 3 lists of galaxies, but `plane_index_limit=1`, the third plane (corresponding to
        index 2) will not be calculated. The `plane_index_limit` is used to avoid uncessary ray tracing calculations
        of higher redshift planes whose galaxies do not have mass profile (and only have light profiles).

        Returns a ray-traced grid of 2D Cartesian (y,x) coordinates, which accounts for multi-plane ray-tracing, at a
        specified input redshift which may be different to the redshifts of all planes.

        Given a list of galaxies whose redshifts define a multi-plane lensing system and an input grid of (y,x) arc-second
        coordinates (e.g. an image-plane grid), ray-trace the grid to an input redshift in of the multi-plane system.

        This is performed using multi-plane ray-tracing and a list of galaxies which are converted into a list of planes
        at a set of redshift. The galaxy mass profiles are used to compute deflection angles. Any redshift can be input
        even if a plane does not exist there, including redshifts before the first plane of the lens system.

        An input `AstroPy` cosmology object can change the cosmological model, which is used to compute the scaling
        factors between planes (which are derived from their redshifts and angular diameter distances). It is these
        scaling factors that account for multi-plane ray tracing effects.

        There are two ways the calculation may be performed:

        1) If the input redshift is the same as the redshift of a plane in the multi-plane system, the grid is ray-traced
        to that plane and the traced grid returned.

        2) If the input redshift is not the same as the redshift of a plane in the multi-plane system, a plane is inserted
        at this redshift and the grid is ray-traced to this plane.

        For example, the input list `galaxies` may contained three `Galaxy` objects at redshifts z=0.5, z=1.0 and z=2.0.
        We can input an image-plane grid and request that its coordinates are ray-traced to a plane at z=1.75 in this
        multi-plane system. This will insert a plane at z=1.75 and use the galaxy's at z=0.5 and z=1.0 to compute
        deflection angles, alongside accounting for multi-plane lensing effects via the angular diameter distances
        between the different galaxy redshifts.

        The `plane_index` input is used to return a specific image of a plane, as opposed to a list of images
        of all planes. This can save on computational time when only the image of a specific plane is needed,

        The images output by this function do not include instrument operations, such as PSF convolution (for imaging

        Inherited methods in the `autogalaxy.operate.image` package can apply these operations to the images.
        These functions may have the `operated_only` input passed to them, which is why this function includes
        the `operated_only` input.

        If the `operated_only` input is included, the function omits light profiles which are parents of
        the `LightProfileOperated` object, which signifies that the light profile represents emission that has
        already had the instrument operations (e.g. PSF convolution, a Fourier transform) applied to it and therefore
        that operation is not performed again.

        Returns the lensed image of a plane or galaxy, where the input image is uniform and interpolated to compute
        the lensed image.

        The typical use case is inputting the image of an irregular galaxy in the source-plane (whose values are
        on a uniform array) and using this function computing the lensed image of this source galaxy.

        By default, this function computes the lensed image of the final plane, which is the source-plane, by using
        `plane_index=-1`. For multi-plane lens systems, the lensed image of any planes can be computed by setting
        `plane_index` to the index of the plane in the lens system.

        The emission of all other planes and galaxies can be included or omitted setting the `include_other_planes`
        bool. If there are multiple planes in a multi-plane lens system, the emission of the other planes are fully
        lensed.

        __Source Plane Interpolation__

        We use the scipy interpolation function `griddata` to create the lensed source galaxy image.

        In brief, we trace light rays to the source plane and calculate values based on where those light rays land in
        the source plane via interpolation.

        In more detail:

        - `points`: The 2D grid of (y,x) coordinates representing the location of every pixel of the source galaxy
          image in the source-plane, from which we are creating the lensed source image. These coordinates are the
          uniform source-plane grid computed after interpolating the irregular mesh the original source reconstruction
          used.

        - `values`: The intensity values of the source galaxy image which is used to create the lensed source image.
           These values are the flux values of the interpolated source galaxy image computed after interpolating the
           irregular mesh the original source reconstruction used.

        - `xi`: The image-plane grid ray traced to the source-plane. This evaluates the flux of each image-plane
          lensed source-pixel by ray-tracing it to the source-plane grid and computing its value by interpolating the
          source galaxy image.

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid
            The image-plane grid which is traced to the plane where the image is computed, where these values are
            used to perform the interpolation.
        plane_image
            The image of the plane or galaxy which is interpolated to compute the lensed image.
        plane_index
            The index of the plane the image is computed, where the default (-1) computes the image in the last plane
            and therefore the source-plane.
