    Returns a list of plane redshifts from a list of galaxies, using the redshifts of the galaxies to determine the

    """
    Returns a ray-traced grid of 2D Cartesian (y,x) coordinates which accounts for multi-plane ray-tracing.

    This uses the redshifts and mass profiles of the galaxies contained within the tracer to perform the multi-plane
    ray-tracing calculation.

    This function returns a list of 2D (y,x) grids, corresponding to each redshift in the input list of planes. The
    plane redshifts are determined from the redshifts of the galaxies in each plane, whereby there is a unique plane
    at each redshift containing all galaxies at the same redshift.

    For example, if the `planes` list contains three lists of galaxies with `redshift`'s z0.5, z=1.0 and z=2.0, the
    returned list of traced grids will contain three entries corresponding to the input grid after ray-tracing to
    redshifts 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0.

    An input `AstroPy` cosmology object can change the cosmological model, which is used to compute the scaling
    factors between planes (which are derived from their redshifts and angular diameter distances). It is these
    scaling factors that account for multi-plane ray tracing effects.

    The calculation can be terminated early by inputting a `plane_index_limit`. All planes whose integer indexes are
    above this value are omitted from the calculation and not included in the returned list of grids (the size of
    this list is reduced accordingly).

    For example, if `planes` has 3 lists of galaxies, but `plane_index_limit=1`, the third plane (corresponding to
    index 2) will not be calculated. The `plane_index_limit` is used to avoid uncessary ray tracing calculations
    of higher redshift planes whose galaxies do not have mass profile (and only have light profiles).

    Parameters
    ----------
    galaxies
        The galaxies whose mass profiles are used to perform multi-plane ray-tracing, where the list of galaxies
        has an index for each plane, correspond to each unique redshift in the multi-plane system.
    grid
        The 2D (y, x) coordinates on which multi-plane ray-tracing calculations are performed.
    cosmology
        The cosmology used for ray-tracing from which angular diameter distances between planes are computed.

        The integer index of the last plane which is used to perform ray-tracing, all planes with an index above
        this value are omitted.

    """
    Returns a ray-traced grid of 2D Cartesian (y,x) coordinates, which accounts for multi-plane ray-tracing, at a
    specified input redshift which may be different to the redshifts of all planes.

    Given a list of galaxies whose redshifts define a multi-plane lensing system and an input grid of (y,x) arc-second
    coordinates (e.g. an image-plane grid), ray-trace the grid to an input redshift in of the multi-plane system.

    This is performed using multi-plane ray-tracing and a list of galaxies which are converted into a list of planes
    at a set of redshift. The galaxy mass profiles are used to compute deflection angles. Any redshift can be input
    even if a plane does not exist there, including redshifts before the first plane of the lens system.

    An input `AstroPy` cosmology object can change the cosmological model, which is used to compute the scaling
    factors between planes (which are derived from their redshifts and angular diameter distances). It is these
    scaling factors that account for multi-plane ray tracing effects.

    There are two ways the calculation may be performed:

    1) If the input redshift is the same as the redshift of a plane in the multi-plane system, the grid is ray-traced
    to that plane and the traced grid returned.

    2) If the input redshift is not the same as the redshift of a plane in the multi-plane system, a plane is inserted
    at this redshift and the grid is ray-traced to this plane.

    For example, the input list `galaxies` may contained three `ag.Galaxy` objects at redshifts z=0.5, z=1.0 and z=2.0.
    We can input an image-plane grid and request that its coordinates are ray-traced to a plane at z=1.75 in this
    multi-plane system. This will insert a plane at z=1.75 and use the galaxy's at z=0.5 and z=1.0 to compute
    deflection angles, alongside accounting for multi-plane lensing effects via the angular diameter distances
    between the different galaxy redshifts.

    """
    Returns the gravitational lensing time delay in days for a grid of 2D (y, x) coordinates.

    This function calculates the time delay at each image-plane position due to both geometric and gravitational
    (Shapiro) effects, as described by the Fermat potential, which are computed using the deflection angles of the
    galaxies in the lens system.

    It requires a two-plane system (lens and source), and does not currently support multi-plane time delay
    calculations involving more than two planes, but it could be extended to do so in the future.

    The time delay is computed as:

    .. math::
        \Delta t(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \frac{D_{\Delta t}}{c} \, \phi(\boldsymbol{\theta})

    where:

    - \( \boldsymbol{\theta} \): image-plane coordinate
    - \( \phi(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \): Fermat potential at each coordinate
    - \( c \): speed of light
    - \( D_{\Delta t} \): time-delay distance

    The time-delay distance is given by:

    .. math::
        D_{\Delta t} = (1 + z_l) \frac{D_d D_s}{D_{ds}}

    with \( D_d, D_s, D_{ds} \) the angular diameter distances to the lens, to the source, and from lens to source.

    The time delay is computed using the Fermat potential,

    An input `AstroPy` cosmology object can change the cosmological model, which is used to compute the scaling
