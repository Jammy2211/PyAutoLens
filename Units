UNITS

Obviously, for images there are lots of units you can use to define things. We'll define all modeling quantities in
units of arcseconds ("), which describe how large an angle the image / pixels subtend on the sky.

To make this definition, we associated a pixel_scale with our 2D imaging data (which is known for any telescope).
So, for a 2D image with 11 x 11 pixels and a pixel scale of 0.1:

(-0.5", 0.5")_____0"____(0.5", 0.5")
             |          |
             |          |
           0"|          | 0"          < ---- Pretend this is 11 x 11 pixels... not just one pixel!
             |          |
             |__________|
(-0.5", -0.5")    0"     (0.5", -0.5")

For our as_array funciton, I have set it up so that our array is just each pixel number (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), which
we shift such that pixel 0 is the central pixel:

x_center = (x_max + x_min)/2.0
y_center = (y_max + y_min)/2.0

for x in range(x_min, x_max):
    for y in range(y_min, y_max):
        array[x, y] = self.flux_at_coordinates(((x - x_center) * pixel_scale, (y - y_center) * pixel_scale))

However, the coordinates we send to flux_at_coordinates have been converted from pixel number (x-x_center) to
arcseconds ((x-x_center)*pixel_scale). This means the light profile is evaluated in arc seconds also.

the light profile parameters are therefore also now in arcseconds, specifically light_profile.center and
light_profile.effective_radius :)

Mass profiles are the same! mass_profile.center, mass_profile.einstein_radius, mass_profile.core_radius etc. are all
arcseconds. (Einstein radius is a weird one, cause its the mass normalization - basically people use some mathmatically
trickier to define the mass in terms of circular apertures).

Obviously, we do want physical quantities, i.e. we don't really want to know a lens is 3" big, we want to know its
10 kilo-parsecs in size, or something. Converting from arcseconds to kpc just requires a redshift and a cosmological
modoel - we'll build this into AutoLens. However, a lot of lenses wown't have a measured redshift, by using arcseconds
we won't have to deal with weird unit conversions when we doont have redshifts.
