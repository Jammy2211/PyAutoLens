[MultiNest]

n_live_points:

This is the total number of live points used by MultiNest to sample non-linear parameter space. More points provides a
more thorough sampling of parameter space, at the expense of taking longer to run. The number of live points required
for accurate sampling depends on the complexity of your parameter space, nevertheless I provide some rough guidelines
below.

Recommended values:

for ~5 non-linear parameters -> 20-40 live points
for ~10 non-linear parameters -> 30-50 live points
for ~20 non-linear parameters -> 50-100 live points
for 25+ non-linear parameters -> 75+ live points


sampling_efficiency:

The sampling efficiency controls the ratio of accepted to total samples a MultiNest search targets. A higher efficiency
will converge on the high likelihood regions of parameter space faster, at the risk of missing the global maxima
solution.

*Recommended Values*

Use 0.8, and reduce to 0.6, 0.4, 0.2 if the inferred solution does not look accurate or you are uncertain if it is the
global maxima.


evidence_tolerance:

The evidence tolerance is MultiNest's stopping criteria - the higher the evidence tolerance, the sooner MultiNest will
stop running. A higher tolerance will provide more accurate errors, but take longer to run.

*Recommended values*

For the early phases of a pipeline, where you are not interested in precise parameter errors / PDF's, use values of
1000-10000 to ensure the non-linear search terminates early. For the final phase, use 0.8, to ensure errors and PDF's
are precisely estimated.


const_efficiency_mode

The sampling efficiency determines the acceptance rate that MultiNest targets. However, if MultiNest is struggling to
map out parameter-space accurately, it will it fall to a lower acceptance rate. Constant efficiency mode forces
MultiNest to maintain the acceptance rate, but aggresively converging on the regions of parameter space that have known
high likelihoods.

This can dramatically reduce run-times, but increases the risk of missing the global maximum likelihood solution.

*Recommend values*

There are two circumstances where I find turning this mode on can lead to fast results without missing the global
maximum solution:

1) When the dimensionality of parameter space is < ~7 parameters.
2) When the priors on the majority of model parameters are initialized using Gaussian priors centred on an accurate
   model from a previous phase.

In general, I would keep this mode switched off, unless you have a lot of images you want to aggressively get running
faster.

importance_nested_sampling:

Importance nested sampling mode uses information from the rejected points to improve the non-linear search accuracy.

*Recommended values*

In my experience, this can slow down the analysis, therefore I would recommend keeping it turned off.

It is useful if  want to use constant_efficiency_mode and retain a robust estimate of the Bayesian evidence. I've 
not found that it leads to any change in parameter estimates.
