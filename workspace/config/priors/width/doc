When the prior of two parameters are linked between two phases, a GaussianPrior is used. The width of this
GaussianPrior (its sigma value) is set using the maximum vaue of either:

- The value of the error inferred for that parameter in the first linking phase.
- The value of the parameter specified in its corresponding prior/width/module.ini config file.

For example, if we have a parameter, p1, which we link between two phases:

- If the error on p1 is 0.01, and the value specified by the config is 0.0001, then the sigma of the GaussianPrior will
  be 0.01.
- Conversely, if the error on p1 is 0.01, but the value specified by the config is 2.0, the sigma of the GaussianPrior
  will be 2.0.

To determine the value specified by the prior/width config file, two types of values are used, absolute ('a') and
relative ('r'):

1) Absolute value - 'a' - In this case, the error assumed on p1 is the value given in the config file.
   For example, for the width on centre_0 of a light profile, the config file reads centre_0 = a, 0.05. This means
   if the error on the parameter centre_0 was less than 0.05 in the previous phase, the sigma of its GaussianPrior
   in this phase will be 0.05.

2) Relative value - 'r' - In this case, the error assumed on the parameter is the % of the value of the best-fit
   value given in the config file. For example, if the intensity estimated in the previous phase was 2.0, and the
   relative error in the config file is specified as intensity = r, 0.5, then the sigma of the GaussianPrior will be
   50% of this best-fit value, i.e. sigma = 0.5 * 2.0 = 1.0.
