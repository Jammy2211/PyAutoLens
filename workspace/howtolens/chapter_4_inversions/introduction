So, we've learnt how to build pipelines that model strong lenses and customize them to our science case.

However, we ran into a pretty huge barrier when trying to fit complex sources. It required an unwieldy number
of non-linear parameters, and even when we included them, the results were rubbish. The non-linear parameter space
was just too complex, and even a well crafted pipeline couldn't fix the problem :(

In this chapter, we'll learn about pixelizations, mappers and inversions. These tools allow us to reconstruct the
source galaxy's not with an analytic light profile, but instead a pixel-grid. In doing so, we make no assumption about
the source's morphology, breaking the simpliying assumptions inherent to analytic light profiles (e.g. symmetry).
Remarkably, pixels grid use just a couple of non-linear parameters, meaning the 30+ non-linear parameters we required
to fit complex-sources before are going to be reduced to just 3 or 4!

Sound good? I agree, so lets get on with it.
