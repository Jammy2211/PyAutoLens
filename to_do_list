__Tasks__

- Logging: DISPLAY EVERYTHING (PSF SIZE, IMAGER SIZE, MASK STUFF, IT WILL STOP BUGS).
- Simulating lenses is slow because the iterate grid is used for all visualization. Make a "sub_size_1" grid property.
- Estimating the PSF preprocess example by fitting Gaussians



__MGE__

- PyAutoArray details but this is priority for PyAutoLens.


__Stochastic LH Built in__

- Summary stats based on Gaussian.
- 1D plot of slope vs LH, split into different LH terms (Also support for other parameters).



__HowToLens__

- Add equations to lectures from likelihood function noteobok.


__Features__

- Mass visualization for large runs in single folder, which works for database runs.
- Database tutorial for big datasets with efficient / fast visuals.
- DM many subhalo sims.
- Automatically blurring grid padding and extraction.


__Source__

- Magnification tools for source models.
- Mapping image arrays (e.g. the data) to the source plane so we can compare how the source-plane appears.
  Do for simple rectangular grid, then add subgrid, interpolation.
- Make magnification equivalent.


__VIsualize__

- Dont put critical curve on all FitImaging plots, it can cover up the cresidails in the centre (e.g. the red cricle of the radial critical curve gets in the way)/.

- Mask zoom, always keep the data square (dont make rectangle) and always keep the centre (0.0, 0.0), as otherwise
one may incorrect thing a critical curve is far offset from (0.0, 0.0).

__Clump API__

- Scripts describing what a clump is.
- Example scripts showing how every clump maker task relates to autofit model composition.
- Point Source Models via PointModel API.
- Gradually build examples of increasing complexity (e.g. using elliptical measurements, luminosity / scaling relations,
hierarchical models, prior passing).
- Rich: API for fitting model sub components one by one, built into clump API.
- Multiwavelength 0_0.


__Point Source__

- Point source visusliazation, RMS of point source.


__Documentation__

- Search chaining readthedocs.

__Bugs__

- Fix fractional accuracy bug where one can end up with dodgy lens light subs if done simultaneously with source.
- Raise exception if mask not applied to imaging and it is passed to analysis.
- No positions analysis bug, need to remove copy or something.
- Point source raises exception if solver grid smaller than data in analysi class.
- Sanity checks on datastructures wherer possible (e.g. output grid index is 2).
- Sanity checks on things like mapper uitil, inversion util, where a user may input an incorrect array (e.g. an unasked
noise map) and not get an error as an index limit is never hit.



__SLam2__

- Source parametric (using linear profiles) solely to estimate positions.

- Lens Light (Sersic or MGE) + SIE or Light Dark + Source Inversion w/ new LH position LH func.
- Source hyper.
- Lens Light (Sersic or MGE) + SIE / PL or Light Dark + Source Inversion w/ new LH position LH func (Refit to improve hyper image).
- Hyper phase.

- Mass total: Lens Light (Optional, default off) + More Complex Mass + Source Inversion w/ new position LH func.
- Mass Light Dark: Mass pipeline specifically for light_dark linear transition.

- Subhalo pipeline.

- BG Sky linear, remove bg sky noise.
- fixed pixel number for source by default.
