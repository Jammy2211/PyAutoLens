__Tasks__

- Build Server: Sort Authentification issues.
- Logging: DISPLAY EVERYTHING (PSF SIZE, IMAGER SIZE, MASK STUFF, IT WILL STOP BUGS).
- GUI code is horrific, clean up, CHECK IF INUT IS SCALED OR PIXELS.


__Features__

- Automated check of deflection angles against integration during lens modeling.
- DM many subhalo sims.


__Point Source__

- Point source visusliazation, RMS of point source.


__Documentation__

- Search chaining readthedocs.
- add https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04665 where applicable.
- FAQ My reconstruction is a demagnified solution.

__Refactor__

- Revert to SciPy quad, remove pyquad not installed.


__Bugs__

- No positions analysis bug, need to remove copy or something.
- Point source raises exception if solver grid smaller than data in analysi class.
- Sanity checks on datastructures wherer possible (e.g. output grid index is 2).
- Sanity checks on things like mapper uitil, inversion util, where a user may input an incorrect array (e.g. an unasked
noise map) and not get an error as an index limit is never hit.
