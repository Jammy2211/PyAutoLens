=================== Sub-gridding =======================
========================================================

For a 2D light or mass profile, we want to compute the intensity of light or deflection ange at the centre of every image
pixel:
  _________
 |         |
 |         |
 |    x    |
 |         |
0|_________|
 0

So for this pixel, its centre is at x = (x,y) = (0.5, 0.5)

However, if the function in this pixel varies over the square area a lot, evaluating its value at just 0.5 risks losing
a small degree of accuracy. Really, what we want to do is perform a line integral over the square above, but that is
expensive, so instead we subgrid it. For exmaple, we may use a 2x2 subgrid:
  _________
 |         |
 |  x   x  |
 |         |
 |  x   x  |
0|_________|
 0

where the four coordinates are at:
x1 = (0.25, 0.25)
x2 = (0.25, 0.75)
x3 = (0.75, 0.25)
x4 = (0.75, 0.75)

Using this sub-grid, we can evaulate he funtion at the four coordinates above and then take the average:
value = (value(x1)+value(x2)+value(x3)+value(x4))/4.0

This is more accurate than using just the centre.

Obviously, the sub-grid can be as coarse as you like - I typically use a 4x4 sub-grid for deflection angles and
an adaptive sub-grid, describes next, for light profiles.

========================================================
============ Computing a 2D Light Profile ==============
========================================================

For a 2D light profile, we what should the sub-grid we use be? Well, this depends on how rapidly changing the
light profile is over that pixel.

In the centre of a Sersic (pixels whose (x,y) coordinates are near (x_cen, y_cen), the light decays faster than an
exponential - so we need very dense subgrid.

At the edges of the light profile (x >> x_cen or y >> y_cen), it flat, we probably don't need a subgrid at all!

Therefore, the light profile is computed using an adaptive subgrid. For each pixel, we compute its value using just the
pixel centre, and then compute it again using a 2x2 subgrid.

If the fractional change in value is small (< ~0.0001), we know that we have accurately sampled that pixels value
and going to a denser sub-grid will not give us much m ore accuracy!

if the fractional change is large (>~0.0001), we need to use a higher density subgird (8x8). This keeps going until we
meet our accuracy threshold. Some light profiles require a subgrid of (100 x 100) or more!

CODE: So, we are going to want some sort of generic LightProfile method that given a light profile and a set of x / y
coordinates, generates the light profile including this sub-gridding. I have fortran code to this, and will write
a function in c++.

========================================================
=========== Computing 2D Deflection Angles =============
========================================================

In contrast to the light profile method above, for the deflection angles we only need the angle at each sub-pixel
location. Once we've calculated them, we don't average them togehter to get the central value. This is because
each sub-pixel is traced to the source plane and included in the source model_instance.

This changes how we can efficiently compute deflection angles in 2D. It is still true that near the lens, the deflection
angles change rapidly, and away from the lens, they don't change much at all.

This means, near the lens centre, we compute every sub-pixel deflection angles explicitly.

 A bit further out, we compute them on a grid, and bilinearly interpolate (average) the values on this grid to
 get sub-pixel deflecton angle at every location.

 Even further from the lens centre, the deflection angles are almost flat, so we perform their calculation on a sparse
 grid and bi-linearly interpolate over this sparse grid to get each sub-pixel value.

CODE: So, we want a MassProfile method that can take a set of x / y points where we compupte the deflection angles,
computes them, and then knows how to compute the sub-pixel values from these values via bilinear interpolation. I
have fortran code which does this (its messy) and will write a cleaner c++ code.

IDEA: Could we have a variable sub-grid? So, pixels where the source iss bright are dense (e.g. 8x8), whereas those
where the source is not are coarse (e.g. 2x2). Might be cool, might not be worth the headache.
