##### HOW DO PRIORS WORK WITH MULTINEST? #####

MultiNest samples a non-linear parameter, which is of dimnesion N, the number of parameters in our lens model that we are
treating as 'free' and therefore trying to estimate the values of.

To do this, MultiNest generates a unit-hypercube of values between 0.0 and 1.0, which is essentially a 1D array of
dimension N. E.g. if we had just two non-linear parameters, so N = 2, we'd have something like:

cube[0] = 0.5
cube[1] = 0.68

Our priors define how we take these unit-hypercube values and translate them to the physical values in our lens model.
So, lets say our two parameters above had the following priors:

parameter_a.prior.type = 'Uniform'
parameter_a.prior.minimum = 0.0
parameter_a.prior.maximum = 3.0

parameter_b.prior.type = 'Gassian'
parameter_b.prior.mean = 1.0
parameter_b_prior.sigma = 8.0

We would simply go over each value of the unit-hypercube and use its corresponding prior to get physical values...

parameter_a.compute_physical_value = 1.5
# Known solution - the inverse error of 0.68 ~= 0.3307, so 1 + (sigma*sqrt(2)*0.3307) ~= 4.74159
parameter_b.compute_physical_value = ~4.74159

So, for each parameter, we basically just define a prior which maps values from 0.0-1.0 to physical values.

The prior modules I use for my CTI code are attatched in PriorCode.

##### SO HOW DO WE SETUP PRIORS FOR PARAMETERS #####

Basically, for each parameter in our lens model that we want to sample with MultiNest (note, we may have some that we
keep fixed whilst sampling others) we want to simply assign it a prior before the analysis. For my CTI code, this went
something like:

parameters = Parameters(trap_density=[0.1, 0.3], trap_lifetime=[1.0, 10.0],
                        well_notch_depth=0.01, well_fill_power=0.8)

parameters.setup_priors(trap_density_prior=[UniPrior(minimum=0.0, maximum=30.0),
                                            UniPrior(minimum=1.0, maximum=10.0)],
                       trap_lifetime_prior=[UniPrior(minimum=0.0, maximum=30.0),
                                            UniPrior(minimum=1.0, maximum=10.0)],
                     well_notch_depth_prior=GaussPrior(mean=1.0, sigma=2.0),
                      well_fill_power_prior=GaussPrior(mean=3.0, sigma=5.0))

So that, for example, parameters.well_file_power.value = 0.8 ( this is setup in the initial call)
                      parameters.well_fill_power.prior.type = 'UNIFORM'
                      parameters.well_fill_power.prior.minimum = 0.0
                      parameters.well_fill_power.set_via_prior(unit_value=0.5, cube_no)
                      parameters.well_file_power.value = 5.0 ( this is updated using the prior above)

I'm sure you can think of a more elegent way to do this....

#### INITIAL PRIORS #################

At the start of an analysis, parameters fall into two categories:

- Those we place uniform priors on based on some basic understanding of a reasonable range of values for that paramater:

    so, we know an axis_ratio can only go between 0.0 and 1.0 (and really low values are unphysical), so we would say
    axis_ratio.prior = UniPrior(minimum=0.2, maximum=1.0)

 - This we have some estimate of from another observation (this will be ML in the future!):

   So, say we measure the brightest pixel in the centre of the lens to be 3.0 electrons per second. We would say
   flux.prior = GaussPrior(mean=3.0, sigma=3.0) (Or use a uniform prior, like I said on facebook).

######## RESULTS OF AN ANALYSIS ##########

At the end of the analysis in one phase of AutoLens, MultiNest has fully sampled non-linear parameter space. This means that,
for each of these lens model parameters we can marginalize it in 1D to compute its posterior probably density function (PDF).

A PDF basically tells us which values of that parameter corresponded to the highest likelihood regions of parameter space.
Thus, we ought to use those values as priors for the next phases MultiNest non-linear search!

Strictly speaking, a PDF is doesn't confirm to any ordinary shape and can have multiple peaks, skewness etc. However,
due to the central limit theorem, in most cases they resemple something vaguely Gausssian. So we can just summarize each
parameters PDF as a Gaussian, with a centre 'mean' and width 'sigma'. We'll often buffer sigma to be larger than the inferred
errors too, as we don't want our next non-linear search to miss solutions due to overly restrictive priors.

So, at the end of an analysis, we have a PDF of every parameter and therefore an estimate of its resulting mean and sigma.
We can just take these results and set them up as Gaussian Priors for the corresponding parameters in the next phase!

####### LINKING PARAMETERS / PRIORS ########

The idea behind AutoLens is that each new phase introduces a small chunk of additional complexity to the lens model.
So, the majority of parameters were estimate in the last phase (and thus have well initialized Gaussian priors), and we
throw in a few extra new parameters with Uniform priors.

At the end of AutoLens, we 'fix' our lens model and every single parameter will be initialized using a prior inferred from
the previous phase.

I think our class inheritance should automatically take care of a lot of linking. So, if we go from an EllipticalIsothermalMassProfile
(5 parameters - x, y, ein_rad, phi, axis_ratio) to an EllipticalPowerLawMassProfile (6 parameters - x, y, ein_rad, phi, axis_ratio, slope),
it should be obvious that the first 5 parameters can inherite from the IsothermalMassProfile and only slope needs special treatment.

A similiar thing is true if we go from the EllipticalIsothermalMassProfile to a NFWDarkMatterMassProfile (6 - parameters,
x,, y, kappa, phi, axis_ratio, scale_radious). The Profile class will tell the new dark matter model that it can use
the x and y of EllipticalIsothermal. Athough phi and axis_ratio are shared between these two profiles, its generally
not wise to assume the Isothermal's axis-ratio or phi (which represent ALL the mass in the lens) correlate with the
axis-ratio and phi oof the dark matter.
