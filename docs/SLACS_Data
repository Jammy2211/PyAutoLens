Hubble Space Telescope images, when reduced, often don't come with a noise-map. Instead, they come with a WHT ('weight')
map, which depending on the data reduction:

Case 1)
- Gives the inverse standard deviation in each pixel e.g. (Noise = 1.0./WHT)
- Contains just the WHT (and therefore noise) from the background noise sources, omitting Poisson noise (Thus, we need
to compute the Poisson noise using the image and effective exposure time map.)

Case 2)
- Gives the inverse variance in each pixel. e.g. (Noise = (1.0./((WHT.^0.5)))
- The WHT (and therefore noise) from the background noise sources and Poisson noise.

Furthermore, to make things worse, the data I currently am sent does not include an effective exposure time map :(.

However, in case 1) we can calculate it from the WHT map as the WHT map only contains background noise sources.
Essentially, each effective exposure tiime can be calculated as:
exposire_time_map = abs((noise./(max(noise)))*total_exposure_time)

For case 2), we cannot compute the exposure time map from the data. In this case, I just use the total exposure time
to make it (knowing that this is wrong).

Example 1 : SLACS_03_WHT_Background

The first example is case 1) above. Thus, the things we need to do to setup the data are:

- The pixel scale is 0.03
- Load the image from hdu=1
- Load the WHT from hdu=2, and convert to the Noise using (Noise = 1.0./WHT)
- Load the PSF from hdu=3
- Calculate the effective_exposure_map using exposure_time =  abs((noise./(max(noise)))*total_exposure_time) where
total_exposure_time = 2088 (seconds)
- Due to an error, the PSF in this image is even x even, meaning we cant use it. But this is all just for testing anyway.

Example 2 : SLACS_03_WHT_All

This is case 2) above, thus we:

- The pixel scale is 0.03
- Load the image from hdu=1
- Load the WHT from hdu=2, and convert to the Noise using (Noise = (1.0./((WHT.^0.5)))
- Load the PSF from hdu=3
- Calculate the effective_exposure_map with all values as 2088.

Example 3 : SLACS_05_WHT_All

This is the same as Example 2, but pixel_scale is 0.05 instead of 0.03 (it was reduced in a different way). The PSF is
also odd for this one :)

Example 4 : SLACS_05_WHT_Background

Same as Example 2 but pixel scale 0.05
