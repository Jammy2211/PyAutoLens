ESTIMATED NOISES:

If an array is defined as 'noise', this means it estimates the standard deviation value in each pixel:

- A standard deviation in function is referred to as 'sigma' throughout the code (e.g.
estimate_noise_in_quadrature(sigma_counts, image_counts).

A variance corresponds to a standard deviation and therefore noise value squared (or sigma squared).

- Because a chi squared is divided by noise values squared, the residuals are divided by variances to compute chi
squared.
- The routine compute_variances_from_noise(noise) performs this conversion.

The Poisson noise in a pixel is computed simply as its total counts squared rooted.

To compute the total noise in a pixel, we thus add sources in quadraturee as:

def estimate_noise_in_quadrature(sigma_std_counts, image_counts):
    return np.sqrt(np.square(sigma_std_counts) + image_counts)

ACTUAL NOISE VALUES:

If an array is defined as 'noise_map', or some variant of (e.g. read_noise_map, poisson_noise_map), this means that is
the actual noise values in each pixel that are known. This is only possible for simulated images. E.g the functions
below return a 'noise_map':

def generate_background_noise_map(dimensions, background_noise, seed=-1):
    setup_random_seed(seed)
    return np.random.normal(0.0, background_noise, dimensions)

def generate_poisson_noise_map(image, exposure_time_map, seed=-1):
    setup_random_seed(seed)
    image_counts = convert_array_to_counts(image, exposure_time_map)
    return image - np.divide(np.random.poisson(image_counts, image.shape), exposure_time_map)

BACKGROUND SKY:

Because we define all images to be in electrons per second, we do not require knowledge of the background sky level to \
simulate or measure noise. We only need to know the background noise values, which are what is typically estimated \
by data reduction piplines.
