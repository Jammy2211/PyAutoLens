Analysis
========

The ``Analysis`` objects define the ``log_likelihood_function`` of how a lens model is fitted to a dataset.

It acts as an interface between the data, model and the non-linear search.

Non-linear Searches
-------------------

A non-linear search is an algorithm which fits a model to data.

**PyAutoLens** currently supports three types of non-linear search algorithms: nested samplers,
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and optimizers.

Priors
------

The priors of parameters of every component of a model, which is fitted to data, are customized using ``Prior`` objects.
