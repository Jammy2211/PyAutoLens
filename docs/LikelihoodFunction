The likelihood function begins after we have set up our Tracer, and are thus able to use it to generate model images
of galaxy profiles and mapping_matrices for pixelization (if pixelizations are turned on). If HyperImage features
are on, it will also performed them.

PROFILE ONLY LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION:

1) Use ray tracing to compute model image of all galaxies.
2) Blur this model image with PSF.
3) Compare to image, using the noise map -> returns likelihood.

PIXELIZATION ONLY LIKELIHOOD FUNCTION:

1) Use ray tracing to compute mapping matrix of all pixelizations (typically only 1).
2) Use mapping matrix, image data, noise and PSF to compute f, F, D and use linear inversion to solve for S (flux in every pixel).
3) Map S back to image, compare to image -> returns likelihood.

PROFILE + PIXELIZATION LIKELIIHOOD FUNCTION:

NOTE - This essentially commbine the two above, but instead subtracts the profile galaxy images from the image data.

1) Use ray tracing to compute model image of all galaxies.
2) Blur this model image with PSF.
3) Subtract from observed image to produce a profile subtracted image (typically, this is just a lens light subtraction)
2) Use mapping matrix, SUBTRACTED image data and PSF to compute f, F, D and use linear inversion to solve for S (flux in every pixel).
3) Map S back to image, compare to image, using the noise map -> returns likelihood.



HYPERIMAGE + PROFILE + PIXELIZATION

NOTE - The hyper image essentially just changes the image and noise map which are used for every other step, so its just
a few extra steps at the start.

1) If background sky is a free hyper-parameter, use it to produce a background-sky scaled image (this image is now the
observed image used in all of the following steps).
2) If the contribution map hyper-parameters are free parameters, use them to produce a new contributioon map.
3) If the noise-map scaling parameters are free parameters, use them to produce a new scaled noise map (this is the noise
map ussed in all of the following steps)
4) Perofrm the PROFILE + PIXELIATION LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIION using the scaled images / contributions / noises.

Although a hyper-parameter may not be a free-parameter in the fit, if it has been used previously (i.e. in a hyper-
parameter optimization) we must still generate its corresponding scaled data quantity.

For example, if in the previous hyper-parameter phase we scaled the noise, we must use that scaled noise map in the
subsequent phase (even though the hyper-parameter is now fixed). This could involve fixing the noise-scaling parameters
to their resulting values and always calling step 3) above, but ideally we would just store the scaled noise map
so as to not repeat step 3 for efficiency).



NOTE ON MULTIPLE GALAXIES:

If we have multiple galaxies with profiles, nothing changes above, we just compute all their profiles at once and blur
with the PSF. If we have multiple galaxies with pixelizations, nothing changes above, we just compute each mapping
matrix individually and combine them to solve for S.
