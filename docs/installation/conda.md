# Installation with conda

## JAX & GPU

**PyAutoLens** runs significantly faster on GPUs — often **50x or more** compared to CPUs.

This acceleration is achieved through \[**JAX**\](<https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html>), which provides GPU and TPU support.

**JAX is installed by default** — a plain `pip install autolens` includes it (the older
`pip install autolens[jax]` command still works and installs the same thing).

The default install includes **CPU-only** JAX. To ensure GPU acceleration, it is recommended that you install JAX with
GPU support **before** installing **PyAutoLens**, by following the official \[JAX installation guide\](<https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>).

If you install **PyAutoLens** without a proper GPU setup, a warning will be displayed.

:::{note}
**Intel Macs**: JAX no longer publishes wheels for Intel (x86_64) macOS, so on these machines
`pip install autolens` automatically installs without JAX and runs on the slower NumPy path — a
warning is printed at import to make this clear. Every other supported platform (Windows, Linux,
Apple-silicon Macs) gets JAX by default.

## Install

Installation via a conda environment circumvents compatibility issues when installing certain libraries. This guide
assumes you have a working installation of [conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

First, update conda:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

Next, create a conda environment (we name this `autolens` to signify it is for the **PyAutoLens** install):

The command below creates this environment with Python 3.12:

```bash
conda create -n autolens python=3.12
```

Activate the conda environment (you will have to do this every time you want to run **PyAutoLens**):

```bash
conda activate autolens
```

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

The latest version of **PyAutoLens** is installed via pip as follows (the command `--no-cache-dir` prevents
caching issues impacting the installation):

```bash
pip install autolens --no-cache-dir
```

This includes JAX by default, enabling the acceleration described above. If you need an install without
JAX on a platform where JAX wheels exist (e.g. a restricted environment), install normally and then run
`pip uninstall jax jaxlib` — **PyAutoLens** detects the absence at import and falls back to the fully
supported (but much slower) NumPy path.

If pip prints warnings about dependency version conflicts, these can usually be ignored — the instructions below
will identify clearly if the installation is a success.

If there are no errors **PyAutoLens** is installed!

If there is an error check out the [troubleshooting section](https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html).

## Workspace

Next, clone the `autolens workspace` (the line `--depth 1` clones only the most recent branch on
the `autolens_workspace`, reducing the download size):

```bash
cd /path/on/your/computer/you/want/to/put/the/autolens_workspace
git clone https://github.com/PyAutoLabs/autolens_workspace --depth 1
cd autolens_workspace
```

Run the `welcome.py` script to get started!

```bash
python3 welcome.py
```

It should be clear that **PyAutoLens** runs without issue.

If there is an error check out the [troubleshooting section](https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html).

## Numba

Numba (<https://numba.pydata.org>) is an optional library which makes **PyAutoLens** run a lot faster, which we
strongly recommend users have installed.

You can install numba via the following command:

```bash
pip install numba --no-cache-dir
```

Some users have experienced difficulties installing numba, which is why it is an optional library. If your
installation is not successful, you can use **PyAutoLens** without it installed for now, to familiarize yourself
with the software and determine if it is the right software for you.

If you decide that **PyAutoLens** is the right software, then I recommend you commit the time to getting a
successful numba install working, with more information provided [at this readthedocs page](https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html)

## Optional

For interferometer analysis there are two optional dependencies that must be installed via the commands:

```bash
pip install pynufft
```

**PyAutoLens** will run without these libraries and it is recommended that you only install them if you intend to
do interferometer analysis.

If you run interferometer code a message explaining that you need to install these libraries will be printed, therefore
it is safe not to install them initially.
