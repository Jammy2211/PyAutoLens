Building From Source
====================

JAX & GPU
---------

**PyAutoLens** runs significantly faster on GPUs â€” often **50x or more** compared to CPUs.

This acceleration is achieved through [**JAX**](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html), which provides GPU and TPU support.

When you install **PyAutoLens** (see instructions below), JAX will also be installed. However, the default installation may not include GPU support.

To ensure GPU acceleration, it is recommended that you install JAX with GPU support **before** installing **PyAutoLens**, by following the official [JAX installation guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

If you install **PyAutoLens** without a proper GPU setup, a warning will be displayed.

Packages
--------

Building from source means that you clone (or fork) the **PyAutoLens** GitHub repository and run **PyAutoLens** from
there. Unlike ``conda`` and ``pip`` this provides a build of the source code that you can edit and change, to
contribute the development **PyAutoLens** or experiment with yourself!

A large amount of **PyAutoLens** functionality is contained in its parent projects:

**PyAutoFit** https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit

**PyAutoArray** https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoArray

**PyAutoGalaxy** https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy

If you wish to build from source all code you may need to build from source these 3 additional
projects. We include below instructions for building just **PyAutoLens** from source or building all projects.

Building Only PyAutoLens
------------------------

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

First, clone (or fork) the **PyAutoLens** GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens

Next, install the **PyAuto** parent projects via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install autoconf
   pip install autofit
   pip install autoarray
   pip install autogalaxy

Next, install the **PyAutoLens** dependencies via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoLens/requirements.txt

Next, install the optional dependency numba via pip  (see `this link <https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_ for a description of numba):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba

For unit tests to pass you will also need the following optional requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pynufft

If you are using a ``conda`` environment, add the source repository as follows:

[NOTE: Certain versions of conda use the command ``conda develop`` (without a dash) instead of those shown below.]

.. code-block:: bash

   conda-develop PyAutoLens

Alternatively, if you are using a Python environment include the **PyAutoLens** source repository in your PYTHONPATH
(noting that you must replace the text ``/path/to`` with the path to the **PyAutoLens** directory on your computer):

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoLens

Finally, check the **PyAutoLens** unit tests run and pass (you may need to install pytest via ``pip install pytest``):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/PyAutoLens
   python3 -m pytest


Building All Projects
---------------------

We upgrade pip to ensure certain libraries install:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

First, clone (or fork) all 4 GitHub repositories:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit
    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoArray
    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoGalaxy
    git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens

Next, install **PyAutoConf** via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install autoconf

Next, install the source build dependencies of each project via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoFit/requirements.txt
   pip install -r PyAutoArray/requirements.txt
   pip install -r PyAutoGalaxy/requirements.txt
   pip install -r PyAutoLens/requirements.txt

Next, install the optional dependency numba via pip  (see `this link <https://pyautolens.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_ for a description of numba):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba

For unit tests to pass you will also need the following optional requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -r PyAutoArray/optional_requirements.txt

If you are using a ``conda`` environment, add each source repository as follows:

[NOTE: Certain versions of conda use the command ``conda develop`` (without a dash) instead of those shown below.]

.. code-block:: bash

   conda-develop PyAutoFit
   conda-develop PyAutoArray
   conda-develop PyAutoGalaxy
   conda-develop PyAutoLens

Alternatively, if you are using a Python environment include each source repository in your PYTHONPATH
(noting that you must replace the text ``/path/to`` with the path to the each directory on your computer):

.. code-block:: bash

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoFit
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoArray
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoGalaxy
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/PyAutoLens

Finally, check the unit tests run and pass for each project (you may need to install pytest via ``pip install pytest``):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/to/PyAutoFit
   python3 -m pytest
   cd ../PyAutoArray
   python3 -m pytest
   cd ../PyAutoGalaxy
   python3 -m pytest
   cd ../PyAutoLens
   python3 -m pytest
