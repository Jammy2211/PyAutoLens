        "Tutorial 5: Linking Phases\n",
        "==========================\n",
        "\n",
        "So, we've learnt that if our parameter space is too complex, our `NonLinearSearch` might fail to find the global\n",
        "maximum solution. However, we also learnt how to ensure this doesn`t happen, by:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) Tuning our priors to the strong lens we're fitting.\n",
        " 2) Making our lens model less complex.\n",
        " 3) Searching non-linear parameter space for longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, each of the above approaches has disadvantages. The more we tune our priors, the less we can generalize our\n",
        "analysis to a different strong lens. The less complex we make our model, the less realistic it is. And if we rely too\n",
        "much on searching parameter space for longer, we could end up with phase`s that take days, weeks or months to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, we're going to combine these 3 approaches so that we can fit complex and realistic lens models in a\n",
        "way that that can be generalized to many different strong lenses. To do this, we'll run 2 phases, and link the lens\n",
        "model inferred in the first phase to the priors of the second phase`s lens model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our first phase will make the same light-traces-mass assumption we made in the previous tutorial. We saw that this\n",
        "gives a reasonable lens model. However, we'll make a couple of extra simplifying assumptions, to really try and bring\n",
        "our lens model complexity down and get the `NonLinearSearch` running fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model we infer above will therefore be a lot less realistic. But it doesn`t matter, because in the second phase\n",
        "we're going to relax these assumptions and get back our more realistic lens model. The beauty is that, by running the\n",
        "first phase, we can use its results to tune the priors of our second phase. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) The first phase should give us a pretty good idea of the lens `Galaxy`'s light and mass profiles, for example its\n",
        " intensity, effective radius and einstein radius.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2) It should also give us a pretty good fit to the lensed source galaxy. This means we'll already know where in\n",
        " source-plane its is located and what its intensity and effective are."
