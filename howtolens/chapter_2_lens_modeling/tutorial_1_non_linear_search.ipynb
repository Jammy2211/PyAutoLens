        "In this example, we're going to find a lens model that provides a good fit to an image, without assuming any knowledge\n",

        "\n",
        "So, whats a `lens model`? It is the combination of `LightProfile`'s and `MassProfile`'s we use to represent a lens galaxy,\n",
        "source galaxy and therefore the strong lens ray-tracing configuration (i.e. the `Tracer`..\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, we have to choose the parametrization of our lens model. We don't need to specify the values of its light\n",
        "and mass profiles (e.g. the centre, einstein_radius, etc.) - only the profiles themselves. In this example,\n",
        "we'll use the following lens model:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) A `SphericalIsothermal` Sphere (SIS) for the lens `Galaxy`'s mass.\n",
        " 2) A `SphericalExponential` `LightProfile`.for the source-`Galaxy`'s light.\n",
        "\n",
        "I'll let you into a secret - this is the same lens model used to simulate the `Imaging` data we're going to fit and\n",
        "we're going to infer the actual parameters I used!\n",
        "\n",
        "So, how do we infer the light and `MassProfile` parameters that give a good fit to our data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well, we could randomly guess a lens model, corresponding to some random set of parameters. We could use this\n",
        "lens model to create a `Tracer` and fit the `Imaging` with it, via a `FitImaging` object. We can quantify how good the\n",
        "fit is using its log likelihood (recall chapter_1/tutorial_8). If we kept guessing lens models, eventually we`d find\n",
        "one that provides a good fit (i.e. high log_likelihood) to the data!\n",
        "\n",
        "It may sound surprising, but this is actually the basis of how lens modeling works. However, we can do a lot better\n",
        "than random guessing. Instead, we track the log likelihood of our previous guesses and guess more models using\n",
        "combinations of parameters that gave higher log_likelihood solutions previously. The idea is that if a set of parameters\n",
        "provided a good fit to the data, another set with similar values probably will too.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is called a `non-linear search` and its a fairly common problem faced by scientists. Over the next few tutorials,\n",

        "An animation of a `NonLinearSearch` fitting a lens model can be found on the following page on our readthedocs. Note\n",

        " 1) Randomly guess a lens model and use its `LightProfile`'s and `MassProfile`'s to set up a lens galaxy, source galaxy\n",

        "\n",
        " 2) Use this `Tracer` and a `MaskedImaging` to generate a model image and compare this model image to the\n",
        " observed strong lens `Imaging` data using a `FitImaging` object, providing the log likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3) Repeat this many times, using the likelihoods of previous fits (typically those with a high log_likelihood) to\n",
