        "In this chapter, you`ve learnt how create and fit strong lenses with **PyAutoLens**. In particular, you`ve learnt:\n",
        "\n",
        " 1) **PyAutoLens** uses Cartesian `Grid`'s of $(y,x)$ coordinates to perform ray-tracing.\n",
        " 2) These `Grid`'s are combined with light and mass profiles to compute images, convergences, potentials and\n",
        " deflection angles.\n",
        " 3) Profiles are combined to make galaxies.\n",
        " 4) Collections of galaxies (at the same redshift) form a plane.\n",
        " 5) A `Tracer` can make an image-plane + source-plane strong lens system.\n",
        " 6) The Universe's cosmology can be input into this `Tracer` to convert unit_label to physical values.\n",
        " 7) The `Tracer`'s image can be used to simulate strong lens `Imaging` observed on a real telescope.\n",
        " 8) This instrument can be fitted, so to as quantify how well a model strong lens system represents the observed image.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this summary, we'll consider how flexible the tools **PyAutoLens** gives you are to study every aspect of a strong lens\n",
        "system. Lets get a `fit` to a strong lens, by setting up an image, mask, tracer, etc."
